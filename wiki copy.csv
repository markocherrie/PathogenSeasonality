Root.organism.name,textESCHERICHIA,"Escherichia is a genus of Gram-negative, non-spore forming, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae.[1] In those species which are inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tracts of warm-blooded animals, Escherichia species provide a portion of the microbially derived vitamin K for their host. A number of the species of Escherichia are pathogenic.[2] The genus is named after Theodor Escherich, the discoverer of Escherichia coli."STAPHYLOCOCCUS,"Staphylococcus is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria. Under the microscope, they appear round (cocci), and form in grape-like clusters.[1]The Staphylococcus genus includes at least 40 species. Of these, nine have two subspecies and one has three subspecies.[2] Most are harmless and reside normally on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and other organisms. Found worldwide, they are a small component of soil microbial flora.[3]"CHLAMYDIA,"Chlamydia is a genus of bacteria that are obligate intracellular parasites. Chlamydia infections are the most common bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in humans and are the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide.[1]The three Chlamydia species include Chlamydia trachomatis (a human pathogen), Chlamydia suis (affects only swine) and Chlamydia muridarum (affects only mice and hamsters).[2] Additionally, three species that were previously classified as Chlamydia have since 1999 been reclassified into the then newly-created Chlamydophila genus: Chlamydophila psittaci, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pecorum."KLEBSIELLA,"Klebsiella is a genus of non-motile, Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, rod-shaped bacteria with a prominent polysaccharide-based capsule.[1] It is named after the German microbiologist Edwin Klebs (1834_1913).Klebsiella species are found everywhere in nature. This is thought to be due to distinct sublineages developing specific niche adaptations, with associated biochemical adaptations which make them better suited to a particular environment. They can be found in water, soil, plants, insects, animals and humans.[2][3]"SHIGELLA,"Shigella is a genus of Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, nonspore-forming, nonmotile, rod-shaped bacteria closely related to Salmonella. The genus is named after Kiyoshi Shiga, who first discovered it in 1897.[1]The causative agent of human shigellosis, Shigella causes disease in primates, but not in other mammals.[2][page needed] It is only naturally found in humans and apes.[3][4] During infection, it typically causes dysentery.[5] Shigella is one of the leading bacterial causes of diarrhea worldwide. Insufficient data exist, but conservative estimates suggest Shigella causes about 90 million cases of severe dysentery, with at least 100,000 of these resulting in death each year, mostly among children in the developing world.[6]"CAMPYLOBACTER,"Campylobacter (meaning ""curved bacteria"") is a genus of Gram-negative, microaerophilic, oxidase-positive, nonfermentative bacteria.[1] Campylobacter species are typically spiral-shaped and able to move via unipolar or bipolar flagella.[1] Most Campylobacter species are pathogenic and can infect humans and other animals. At least a dozen species of Campylobacter have been implicated in human disease, with C. jejuni and C. coli the most common.[2] C. jejuni is now recognized as one of the main causes of bacterial foodborne disease in many developed countries.[2][3] C. fetus is a cause of spontaneous abortions in cattle and sheep, as well as an opportunistic pathogen in humans.[4]"PLESIOMONAS,"Plesiomonas shigelloides is a species of bacteria.[1] It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium which has been isolated from freshwater, freshwater fish, and shellfish and from many types of animals including cattle, goats, swine, cats, dogs, monkeys, vultures, snakes, and toads.Infections from this organism cause gastroenteritis, followed by septicemia in immune deficient patients. It is placed among the Enterobacteriaceae. Some Plesiomonas strains share antigens with Shigella sonnei, and cross-reactions with Shigella antisera occur. Plesiomonas can be distinguished from Shigella in diarrheal stools by an oxidase test: Plesiomonas is oxidase positive and Shigella is oxidase negative. Plesiomonas is negative for DNAse; this and other biochemical tests distinguish it from Aeromonas sp."MORGANELLA,"Morganella morganii is a species of Gram-negative bacteria.[1] It has a commensal relationship within the intestinal tracts of humans, mammals, and reptiles as normal flora.[1] Although M. morganii has a wide distribution, it is considered an uncommon cause of community-acquired infection and it is most often encountered in postoperative and other nosocomial infections such as urinary tract infections.[3]"GIARDIA,"Giardia is a genus of anaerobic flagellated protozoan parasites of the phylum Sarcomastigophora that colonise and reproduce in the small intestines of several vertebrates, causing giardiasis. Their life cycle alternates between an actively swimming trophozoite and an infective, resistant cyst. Giardia were first described by the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1681.[1] The genus is named after French zoologist Alfred Mathieu Giard.[2]"CITROBACTER,"Citrobacter is a genus of Gram-negative coliform bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae family.The species C. amalonaticus, C. koseri, and C. freundii can use citrate as a sole carbon source. Citrobacter species are differentiated by their ability to convert tryptophan to indole, ferment lactose, and use malonate.[1]Citrobacter shows the ability to accumulate uranium by building phosphate complexes.[2]"MYCOPLASMA,"Mycoplasma is a genus of bacteria that lack a cell wall around their cell membrane.[1] Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. They can be parasitic or saprotrophic. Several species are pathogenic in humans, including M. pneumoniae, which is an important cause of atypical pneumonia and other respiratory disorders, and M. genitalium, which is believed to be involved in pelvic inflammatory diseases. Mycoplasma species are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered,[2] can survive without oxygen, and are typically about 0.1  micrometres in diameter. Hundreds of mycoplasmae infect animals.[3]"STREPTOCOCCUS,"Streptococcus is a genus of coccus (spherical) Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes[3] and the Lactobacillales (lactic acid bacteria) order. Cellular division occurs along a single axis in these bacteria, and thus they grow in chains or pairs, hence the name from Greek streptos, meaning easily bent or twisted, like a chain (twisted chain).Contrast this with Staphylococci, which divide along multiple axes and generate grape-like clusters of cells. Most Streptococci are oxidase- and catalase-negative, and many are facultative anaerobes.In 1984, many organisms formerly considered Streptococcus were separated out into the genera Enterococcus and Lactococcus.[4] Currently, over 50 species are recognised in this genus."REOVIRUSES,"Reoviridae is a family of viruses. They have a wide host range, including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and fungi.[1] There are currently 87 species in this family, divided among 30 genera.[2] Reoviruses can affect the gastrointestinal system (such as Rotavirus) and respiratory tract.[3] The name ""Reo-"" is derived from respiratory enteric orphan viruses.[4] The term ""orphan virus"" refers to the fact that some of these viruses have been observed not associated with any known disease. Even though viruses in the Reoviridae family have more recently been identified with various diseases, the original name is still used.Reovirus infection occurs often in humans, but most cases are mild or subclinical. Rotavirus, however, can cause severe diarrhea and intestinal distress in children. The virus can be readily detected in feces, and may also be recovered from pharyngeal or nasal secretions, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood. Despite the ease of finding Reovirus in clinical specimens, their role in human disease or treatment is still uncertain.Some viruses of this family infect plants. For example, Phytoreovirus and Oryzavirus."PASTEURELLA,"Pasteurella is a genus of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria.[1][2] Pasteurella species are nonmotile and pleomorphic. Most species are catalase- and oxidase-positive.[3] The genus is named after the French chemist and microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, who first identified the bacteria now known as Pasteurella multocida as the agent of chicken cholera."ASPERGILLUS,"Aspergillus is a genus consisting of a few hundred mold species found in various climates worldwide.Aspergillus was first catalogued in 1729 by the Italian priest and biologist Pier Antonio Micheli. Viewing the fungi under a microscope, Micheli was reminded of the shape of an aspergillum (holy water sprinkler), from Latin spargere (to sprinkle), and named the genus accordingly.[1] Today, aspergillum is also the name of an asexual spore-forming structure common to all Aspergillus species; around one-third of species are also known to have a sexual stage."ENTEROVIRUS,"Enteroviruses are a genus of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses associated with several human and mammalian diseases. Serologic studies have distinguished 71 human enterovirus serotypes on the basis of antibody neutralization tests. Additional antigenic variants have been defined within several of the serotypes on the basis of reduced or nonreciprocal cross-neutralization between variant strains. On the basis of their pathogenesis in humans and animals, the enteroviruses were originally classified into four groups, polioviruses, Coxsackie A viruses (CA), Coxsackie B viruses (CB), and echoviruses, but it was quickly realized that there were significant overlaps in the biological properties of viruses in the different groups. Enteroviruses isolated more recently are named with a system of consecutive numbers: EV68, EV69, EV70, EV71, etc.[1]Enteroviruses affect millions of people worldwide each year, and are often found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) and stool of an infected person. Historically, poliomyelitis was the most significant disease caused by an enterovirus, poliovirus. There are 64 non-polio enteroviruses that can cause disease in humans: 23 Coxsackie A viruses, 6 Coxsackie B viruses, 28 echoviruses, and 5 other enteroviruses.[2] Poliovirus, as well as coxsackie and echovirus are spread through the fecal-oral route. Infection can result in a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild respiratory illness (common cold), hand, foot and mouth disease, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, severe neonatal sepsis-like disease, and acute flaccid paralysis.[2]"PSEUDOMONAS,"Pseudomonas is a genus of Gram-negative, aerobic gammaproteobacteria, belonging to the family Pseudomonadaceae containing 191 validly described species.[1] The members of the genus demonstrate a great deal of metabolic diversity, and consequently are able to colonize a wide range of niches.[2] Their ease of culture in vitro and availability of an increasing number of Pseudomonas strain genome sequences has made the genus an excellent focus for scientific research; the best studied species include P. aeruginosa in its role as an opportunistic human pathogen, the plant pathogen P. syringae, the soil bacterium P. putida, and the plant growth-promoting P. fluorescens.Because of their widespread occurrence in water and plant seeds such as dicots, the pseudomonads were observed early in the history of microbiology. The generic name Pseudomonas created for these organisms was defined in rather vague terms by Walter Migula in 1894 and 1900 as a genus of Gram-negative, rod-shaped and polar-flagellated bacteria with some sporulating species,[3][4] the latter statement was later proved incorrect and was due to refractive granules of reserve materials.[5] Despite the vague description, the type species, Pseudomonas pyocyanea (basonym of Pseudomonas aeruginosa), proved the best descriptor.[5]"HAEMOPHILUS,"Haemophilus is a genus of Gram-negative, pleomorphic, coccobacilli bacteria belonging to the Pasteurellaceae family.[1][2] While Haemophilus bacteria are typically small coccobacilli, they are categorized as pleomorphic bacteria because of the wide range of shapes they occasionally assume. The genus includes commensal organisms along with some significant pathogenic species such as H. influenzae_a cause of sepsis and bacterial meningitis in young children_and H. ducreyi, the causative agent of chancroid. All members are either aerobic or facultatively anaerobic."AEROMONAS,"Aeromonas is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that morphologically resembles members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Most of the 14 described species have been associated with human diseases. The most important pathogens are A. hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. veronii biovar sobria. The organisms are ubiquitous in fresh and brackish water. [1]They group with the gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria.[2]Two major diseases associated with Aeromonas are gastroenteritis and wound infections, with or without bacteremia. Gastroenteritis typically occurs after the ingestion of contaminated water or food, whereas wound infections result from exposure to contaminated water.Although some potential virulence factors (e.g. endotoxins, hemolysins, enterotoxins, adherence factors) have been identified, their precise roles are unknown. Aeromonas species cause:opportunistic systemic disease in immunocompromised patientsdiarrheal disease in otherwise healthy individualswound infections"PARVOVIRUS B19,"Primate erythroparvovirus 1, generally referred to as B19 virus, parvovirus B19[1] or sometimes erythrovirus B19,[2] was the first (and until 2005 the only) known human virus in the family Parvoviridae, genus Erythroparvovirus; it measures only 23_26 nm in diameter.[3] The name is derived from Latin, parvum meaning small, reflecting the fact that B19 ranks among the smallest DNA viruses. B19 virus is most known for causing disease in the pediatric population; however, it can also affect adults. It is the classic cause of the childhood rash called fifth disease or erythema infectiosum, or ""slapped cheek syndrome."" [4][5]The virus was discovered by chance in 1975 by Australian virologist Yvonne Cossart.[5][6] It gained its name because it was discovered in well B19 of a large series of microtiter plates labelled in this way.[5][7]"CANDIDA,"Candida is a genus of yeasts and is the most common cause of fungal infections worldwide.[1] Many species are harmless commensals or endosymbionts of hosts including humans; however, when mucosal barriers are disrupted or the immune system is compromised they can invade and cause disease.[2] Candida albicans is the most commonly isolated species, and can cause infections (candidiasis or thrush) in humans and other animals. In winemaking, some species of Candida can potentially spoil wines.[3]Many species are found in gut flora, including C. albicans in mammalian hosts, whereas others live as endosymbionts in insect hosts.[4][5][6]Systemic infections of the bloodstream and major organs (candidemia or invasive candidiasis), particularly in immunocompromised patients, affect over 90,000 people a year in the U.S.[7]The DNA of several Candida species has been sequenced.[7]Antibiotics promote yeast infections, including gastrointestinal Candida overgrowth, and penetration of the GI mucosa.[8] While women are more susceptible to genital yeast infections, men can also be infected. Certain factors, such as prolonged antibiotic use, increase the risk for both men and women. People with diabetes or impaired immune systems, such as those with HIV, are more susceptible to yeast infections.[9][10]Candida antarctica is a source of industrially important lipases."ASCARIS,"Ascaris is a genus of parasitic nematode worms known as the ""small intestinal roundworms"", which is a type of helminth. One species, Ascaris lumbricoides, affects humans and causes the disease ascariasis. Another species, Ascaris suum, typically infects pigs. Parascaris equorum, the equine roundworm, is also commonly called an ""Ascarid.""[1]Their eggs are deposited in feces and soil. Plants with the eggs on them infect any organism that consumes them.[2] A. lumbricoides is the largest intestinal roundworm and is the most common helminth infection of humans worldwide. Infestation can cause morbidity by compromising nutritional status,[3] affecting cognitive processes,[citation needed] inducing tissue reactions such as granuloma to larval stages, and by causing intestinal obstruction, which can be fatal."DIPHTHEROIDES,INFLUENZA VIRUS,"The Orthomyxoviruses are a family of RNA viruses that includes six genera: Influenza virus A, Influenza virus B, Influenza virus C, Isavirus, Thogotovirus and Quaranjavirus. The first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates, including birds (see also avian influenza), humans, and other mammals. Isaviruses infect salmon; the thogotoviruses are arboviruses, infecting vertebrates and invertebrates, such as ticks and mosquitoes.[2][3][4]The three genera of Influenza virus, which are identified by antigenic differences in their nucleoprotein and matrix protein, infect vertebrates as follows:Influenza virus A infects humans, other mammals, and birds, and causes all flu pandemicsInfluenza virus B infects humans and sealsInfluenza virus C infects humans, pigs and dogs."CRYPTOSPORIDIUM,"Cryptosporidium is a genus of apicomplexan protozoans that can cause gastrointestinal illness with diarrhea in humans. Cryptosporidium is the organism most commonly isolated in HIV-positive patients presenting with diarrhea. Treatment is symptomatic, with fluid rehydration, electrolyte correction and management of any pain. Cryptosporidium oocysts are 4-6 micrometres in diameter and exhibit partial acid-fast staining. They must be differentiated from other partially acid-fast organisms including Cyclospora cayetanensis."HERPES VIRUSES,"Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), also known as human herpesvirus 1 and 2 (HHV-1 and HHV-2), are two members of the herpesvirus family, Herpesviridae, that infect humans.[1] Both HSV-1 (which produces most cold sores) and HSV-2 (which produces most genital herpes) are ubiquitous and contagious. They can be spread when an infected person is producing and shedding the virus. Herpes simplex can be spread through contact with saliva, such as sharing drinks.Symptoms of herpes simplex virus infection include watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes of the mouth, lips or genitals.[1] Lesions heal with a scab characteristic of herpetic disease. Sometimes, the viruses cause very mild or atypical symptoms during outbreaks. However, as neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses, HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system in the cell bodies of neurons. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience sporadic episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transported via the neuron's axon to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores.[2] It is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.[3]"HOOKWORM,"Hookworm infection, also known as hookworm disease, is an infection by a parasitic bloodsucking roundworm. Hookworm infections include ancylostomiasis and necatoriasis. These worms live in the small intestine of their host, which may be a bird or a mammal such as a dog, cat, or human. Hookworm infection in pregnancy can cause retarded growth of the fetus, premature birth and a low birth weight. Hookworms in children can cause intellectual, cognitive and growth problems.Two species of hookworms commonly infect humans: Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. A. duodenale predominates in the Middle East, North Africa, India and (formerly) in southern Europe, while N. americanus predominates in the Americas, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, China, and Indonesia. A. tubaeforme infects cats, A. caninum infects dogs and A. braziliense and Uncinaria stenocephala infect both cats and dogs. Hookworms are much smaller than the giant roundworms Ascaris lumbricoides and so cause less tissue damage and obstruction. The most significant risk of hookworm infection is anemia, secondary to loss of iron (and protein) in the gut. The worms suck blood voraciously and damage the mucosa. However, the blood loss in the stools is not visibly apparent.Hookworm infection affects over half a billion people globally.[1] It is a leading cause of maternal and child morbidity in the developing countries of the tropics and subtropics. In developed countries, hookworm infection is rarely fatal, but anemia can be significant in a heavily infected individual. Hookworm infection is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis and therefore classified as a neglected tropical disease.[2] Ancylostomiasis is the disease caused when Ancylostoma duodenale hookworms, present in large numbers, produce an iron deficiency anemia by sucking blood from the host's intestinal walls."ENTEROCOCCUS,"Enterococcus is a large genus of lactic acid bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes. Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci that often occur in pairs (diplococci) or short chains, and are difficult to distinguish from streptococci on physical characteristics alone.[2] Two species are common commensal organisms in the intestines of humans: E. faecalis (90-95%) and E. faecium (5-10%). Rare clusters of infections occur with other species, including E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, and E. raffinosus.[2]"RUBELLA VIRUS,"Rubella virus (RuV) is the pathogenic agent of the disease rubella, and is the cause of congenital rubella syndrome when infection occurs during the first weeks of pregnancy.Rubella virus is the only member of the genus Rubivirus and belongs to the family of Togaviridae, whose members commonly have a genome of single-stranded RNA of positive polarity which is enclosed by an icosahedral capsid.The molecular basis for the causation of congenital rubella syndrome are not yet completely clear, but in vitro studies with cell lines showed that rubella virus has an apoptotic effect on certain cell types. There is evidence for a p53-dependent mechanism.[1]"CORYNEBACTERIUM,"Corynebacterium (k_r""u-n_-bak-t_r'_-um, ku-rin'u-) is a genus of Gram-positive, aerobe, rod-shaped bacteria. They are widely distributed in nature and are mostly innocuous.[1] Some are useful in industrial settings such as C. glutamicum.[2] Others can cause human disease, including most notably diphtheria which is caused by C. diphtheriae."BACTEROIDES,"Bacteroides is a genus of Gram-negative, obligate anaerobic bacteria. Bacteroides species are non-endospore-forming bacilli, and may be either motile or non-motile, depending on the species.[1] The DNA base composition is 40-48% GC. Unusual in bacterial organisms, Bacteroides membranes contain sphingolipids. They also contain meso-diaminopimelic acid in their peptidoglycan layer.Bacteroides are normally mutualistic, making up the most substantial portion of the mammalian gastrointestinal flora,[2] where they play a fundamental role in processing of complex molecules to simpler ones in the host intestine.[3][4][5] As many as 1010-1011 cells per gram of human feces have been reported.[6] They can use simple sugars when available; however, the main sources of energy for Bacteroides species in the gut are complex host-derived and plant glycans.[7] Studies indicate that long-term diet is strongly associated with the gut microbiome composition - those who eat plenty of protein and animal fats have predominantly Bacteroides bacteria, while for those who consume more carbohydrates the Prevotella species dominate.[8]One of the most important clinically is Bacteroides fragilis.Bacteroides melaninogenicus has recently been reclassified and split into Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella intermedia.[9]"ENTEROBACTER,"Enterobacter is a genus of common Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Several strains of these bacteria are pathogenic and cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised (usually hospitalized) hosts and in those who are on mechanical ventilation. The urinary and respiratory tracts are the most common sites of infection. The genus Enterobacter is a member of the coliform group of bacteria. It does not belong to the fecal coliforms (or thermotolerant coliforms) group of bacteria, unlike Escherichia coli, because it is incapable of growth at 44.5 degrees C in the presence of bile salts. Some of them showed quorum sensing properties as reported before [1][2]Two clinically important species from this genus are E. aerogenes and E. cloacae."PNEUMOCYSTIS,"Pneumocystidomycetes is a class of ascomycete fungi. It includes the single order Pneumocystidales, which contains the single monotypic family Pneumocystidaceae, which in turn contains the genus Pneumocystis."TRICHOSTRONGYLUS,"Trichostrongylus species are nematodes (round worms), which are ubiquitous among herbivores worldwide, including cattle, sheep, donkeys, goats, deer, and rabbits.[1][2][3] At least 10 Trichostrongylus species have been associated with human infections.[1] Infections occur via ingestion of infective larvae from contaminated vegetables or water.[1][3] Epidemiological studies indicate a worldwide distribution of Trichostrongylus infections in humans, with the highest prevalence rates observed in individuals from regions with poor sanitary conditions, in rural areas, or who are farmers / herders.[4][5] Human infections are most prevalent in the Middle East and Asia,[3] with a worldwide estimated prevalence of 5.5 million people.[1]"YERSINIA,"Yersinia is a genus of bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Yersinia species are Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria, a few micrometers long and fractions of a micrometer in diameter, and are facultative anaerobes.[1] Some members of Yersinia are pathogenic in humans; in particular, Y. pestis is the causative agent of the plague. Rodents are the natural reservoirs of Yersinia; less frequently, other mammals serve as the host. Infection may occur either through blood (in the case of Y. pestis) or in an alimentary fashion, occasionally via consumption of food products (especially vegetables, milk-derived products, and meat) contaminated with infected urine or feces.Speculations exist as to whether or not certain Yersinia can also be spread by protozoonotic mechanisms, since Yersinia species are known to be facultative intracellular parasites; studies and discussions of the possibility of amoeba-vectored (through the cyst form of the protozoan) Yersinia propagation and proliferation are now in progress.[2]"TOXOPLASMA,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate, intracellular, parasitic protozoan that causes the disease toxoplasmosis.[1] Found worldwide, T. gondii is capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals,[2] although felids such as domestic cats are the only known definitive hosts in which the parasite can undergo sexual reproduction.[3]In humans, T. gondii is one of the most common parasites;[4] serological studies estimate that 30-50% of the global population has been exposed to and may be chronically infected with T. gondii, although infection rates differ significantly from country to country.[5][6] For example, previous estimates have shown the highest prevalence of persons infected with T. gondii to be in France, at 84%.[7] Although mild, flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks following exposure, infection with T. gondii produces no readily observable symptoms in healthy human adults.[5][8][9] This asymptomatic state of infection is referred to as a latent infection and has recently been associated with numerous subtle adverse or pathological behavioral alterations in humans.[5][10] In infants, HIV/AIDS patients, and others with weakened immunity, infection can cause serious and occasionally fatal illness (toxoplasmosis).[8][9]T. gondii has been shown to alter the behavior of infected rodents in ways thought to increase the rodents' chances of being preyed upon by cats.[7][11][12] Support for this ""Manipulation Hypothesis"" stems from studies showing T. gondii infected rats have a decreased aversion to cat urine and increased reaction time.[7] Because cats are the only hosts within which T. gondii can sexually reproduce to complete and begin its lifecycle, such behavioral manipulations are thought to be evolutionary adaptations to increase the parasite's reproductive success.[7] The primary mechanisms of T. gondii_induced behavioral changes in rodents is now known to occur through epigenetic remodeling in neurons which govern the associated behaviors;[13][14] for example, it modifies epigenetic methylation to cause hypomethylation of arginine vasopressin-related genes in the medial amygdala to greatly decrease predator aversion.[13][14] Widespread histone-lysine acetylation in cortical astrocytes appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by T. gondii.[15][16] Differences in aversion to cat urine are observed between non-infected and infected humans and sex differences within these groups were apparent as well.[17]A number of studies have suggested subtle behavioral or personality changes may occur in infected humans,[18] and infection with the parasite has recently been associated with a number of neurological disorders, particularly schizophrenia.[12] A 2015 study also found cognitive deficits in adults to be associated with joint infection by both toxoplasma gondii and helicobacter pylori in a regression model with controls for race-ethnicity and educational attainment.[19] However, although a causal relationship between latent toxoplasmosis with these neurological phenomena has not yet been established,[5][12] preliminary evidence suggests that T. gondii infection can induce some of the same alterations in the human brain as those observed in mice.[20][21]"PLASMODIUM,"Plasmodium, commonly known as the malaria parasite, is a large genus of parasitic protozoa. As with some other genera of clinically important microorganisms, the genus name also yields a common noun; thus species of the genus are known as plasmodia. Infection with plasmodia is known as malaria, a deadly disease widespread in the tropics.The parasite always has two hosts in its life cycle: a mosquito vector and a vertebrate host. The life-cycle is very complex, involving a sequence of different stages both in the vector and the host. These stages include sporozoites which are injected by the mosquito vector into the host's blood; latent hypnozoites which may rest undetected in the liver for up to 30 years; merosomes and merozoites which infect the red cells (erythrocytes) of the blood; trophozoites which grow in the red cells, and schizonts which divide there, producing more merozoites which leave to infect more red cells; and male and female sexual forms, gametocytes, which are taken up by other mosquitoes. In the mosquito's midgut, the gametocytes develop into gametes which fertilize each other to form motile zygotes which escape the gut, only to grow into new sporozoites which move to the mosquito's salivary glands, from where they are injected into the mosquito's next host, infecting it and restarting the cycle.The genus Plasmodium was first described in 1885. It now contains about 200 species divided into several subgenera; as of 2006 the taxonomy was shifting, and species from other genera are likely to be added to Plasmodium. At least ten species infect humans; other species infect other animals, including birds, reptiles and rodents, while 29 species infect non-human primates. The parasite is thought to have originated from Dinoflagellates, photosynthetic protozoa.The most common forms of human malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, and P. malariae. P. falciparum, common in sub-Saharan Africa, and P. knowlesi, common in Southeast Asia, are especially dangerous."CLOSTRIDIUM,"Clostridium is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes. They are obligate anaerobes capable of producing endospores.[1][2] Individual cells are rod-shaped, which gives them their name, from the Greek kloster or spindle. These characteristics traditionally defined the genus; but many species originally classified as Clostridium have been reclassified in other genera."PARAMYXOVIRUSES,"Paramyxoviridae (from Greek para-, beyond, -myxo-, mucus or slime, plus virus, from Latin poison, slime) is a family of viruses in the order Mononegavirales. Human, vertebrates, and birds serve as natural hosts. There are currently 36 species in this family, divided among 18 genera. Diseases associated with this negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus family include: measles, mumps, respiratory tract infections.[1][2][3]"PROTEUS,"Proteus is a genus of Gram-negative Proteobacteria. Proteus bacilli are widely distributed in nature as saprophytes, being found in decomposing animal matter, sewage, manure soil, and human and animal feces. They are opportunistic pathogens, commonly responsible for urinary and septic infections, often nosocomial."LISTERIA,"Listeria is a genus of bacteria that contains 10 species,[1][2] each containing two subspecies. Named after the English pioneer of sterile surgery Joseph Lister, the genus received its current name in 1940. Listeria species are gram-positive, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic, and non-spore forming.[3] The major human pathogen in the Listeria genus is L. monocytogenes. It is usually the causative agent of the relatively rare bacterial disease, listeriosis, a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacteria. The disease affects pregnant women, newborns, adults with weakened immune systems, and the elderly.Listeriosis is a serious disease for humans; the overt form of the disease has a case-fatality rate of about 20 percent. The two main clinical manifestations are sepsis and meningitis. Meningitis is often complicated by encephalitis, when it is known as meningoencephalitis, a pathology that is unusual for bacterial infections. Listeria ivanovii is a pathogen of mammals, specifically ruminants, and has rarely caused listeriosis in humans.[4]"VEILLONELLA,"Veillonella are Gram-negative anaerobic cocci. This bacterium is well known for its lactate fermenting abilities. They are a normal bacterium in the intestines and oral mucosa of mammals. In humans they have been rarely implicated in cases of osteomyelitis and endocarditis, for example with the species Veillonella parvula."MYCOBACTERIUM,"Mycobacterium is a genus of Actinobacteria, given its own family, the Mycobacteriaceae. The genus includes pathogens known to cause serious diseases in mammals, including tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and the classic Hansen's strain of leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae).[1] The Greek prefix myco- means ""fungus,"" alluding to the way mycobacteria have been observed to grow in a mold-like fashion on the surface of liquids when cultured.[2]"RHINOVIRUS,"Rhinoviruses (from the Greek (gen.) ""nose"") are the most common viral infectious agents in humans and are the predominant cause of the common cold. Rhinovirus infection proliferates in temperatures between 33-35 degrees C, the temperatures found in the nose. Rhinoviruses consist of three species in the genus Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family of viruses.There are 99 recognized types of human rhinoviruses that differ according to their surface proteins. They are lytic in nature and are among the smallest viruses, with diameters of about 30 nanometers. By comparison, other viruses such as smallpox and vaccinia are around 10 times larger at about 300 nanometers."NEISSERIA,"Neisseria is a large genus of bacteria that colonize the mucosal surfaces of many animals. Of the 11 species that colonize humans, only two are pathogens, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. Most gonoccocal infections are asymptomatic and self-resolving, and epidemic strains of the meningococcus may be carried in >95% of a population where systemic disease occurs at <1% prevalence.Neisseria species are Gram-negative bacteria included among the proteobacteria, a large group of Gram-negative forms. Neisseria diplococci resemble coffee beans when viewed microscopically.[1]"ENTAMOEBA,"Entamoeba is a genus of Amoebozoa found as internal parasites or commensals of animals.In 1875, Fedor Losch described the first proven case of amoebic dysentery in St Petersburg, Russia. He referred to the amoeba he observed microscopically as 'Amoeba coli'; however it is not clear whether he was using this as a descriptive term or intended it as a formal taxonomic name.[1] The genus Entamoeba was defined by Casagrandi and Barbagallo for the species Entamoeba coli, which is known to be a commensal organism.[2] Losch's organism was renamed Entamoeba histolytica by Fritz Schaudinn in 1903; he later died, in 1906, from a self-inflicted infection when studying this amoeba. For a time during the first half of the 20th century the entire genus Entamoeba was transferred to Endamoeba, a genus of amoebas infecting invertebrates about which little is known. This move was reversed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in the late 1950s, and Entamoeba has stayed 'stable' ever since."ACTINOMYCES,"Actinomyces (from Greek ""actis"" ray, beam and ""mykes"", fungus) is a genus of the actinobacteria class of bacteria. They are all gram-positive. Actinomyces are facultatively anaerobic (except A. meyeri, a strict anaerobe). All species grow best under anaerobic conditions. Actinomyces species may form endospores, and, while individual bacteria are rod-shaped, Actinomyces colonies form fungus-like branched networks of hyphae.[1] The aspect of these colonies initially led to the incorrect assumption that the organism was a fungus and to the name ""Actinomyces"" or ray fungus.Actinomyces are known for causing disease in humans, and for the important role they play in soil ecology. They produce a number of enzymes that help degrade organic plant material, lignin, and chitin. As such, their presence is important in the formation of compost. Some species have been found as part of the healthy vaginal microbiota.[2]"KINGELLA,"Kingella kingae is a species of Gram-negative aerobic coccobacilli. First isolated in 1960, it was not recognized as a significant cause of infection in young children until the 1990s, when culture techniques had improved enough for it to be recognized. It is best known as a cause of septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, spondylodiscitis, bacteraemia, and endocarditis, and less frequently lower respiratory tract infections and meningitis.[1]There are four species of Kingella: K. kingae, the most common, is part of the bacterial flora of the throat in young children and is transmitted from child to child. When it causes disease, the clinical presentation is often subtle and preceded by a recent history of stomatitis or upper respiratory infection. Other species are K. indologenes, K. denitrificans both causing endocarditis, and K. oralis found in dental plaque.One notable exception is in cases of endocarditis (heart valve infection), which can be more refractory to treatment. K. kingae is the fifth member of the HACEK group of fastidious Gram-negative bacteria that cause endocarditis. Routine laboratory tests may be normal because the organism is difficult to culture. Inoculating the fluid from infected joints directly into blood culture vials can enhance the chances of an accurate culture, but extended culture times are not helpful.[2]The organism has also been known as Moraxella kingae.K. kingae is oxidase-positive, catalase-negative, and beta-hemolytic."TRICHURIS,"Trichuris, often referred to as whipworms (which typically refers to T. trichiura only in medicine, and to any other species in veterinary medicine), is a genus of parasite worms from the roundworm family Trichuridae, which is a type of helminth. The name whipworm refers to the shape of the worm; they look like whips with wider ""handles"" at the posterior end. The name Trichocephalus is sometimes used for this genus.[1]The genus Trichuris includes over 20 species which infect the large intestine of their host including:Trichuris trichiura (sometimes Trichocephalus trichiuris) - causes trichuriasis in humans]Trichuris campanula (cat whipworm)Trichuris suis (pig whipworm)Trichuris muris (mouse whipworm)Trichuris vulpis (dog whipworm)A new species - as yet unnamed - has been identified in Franois leaf monkey(Trachypithecus francoisi).[2]Other species in this genus include Trichuris cynocephalus, Trichuris discolor, Trichuris laevitestis,Trichuris pardinasi, Trichuris navonae,Trichuris ovis, Trichuris rhinopithecus, Trichuris thrichomysi and Trichuris travassosi.Trichurias is a soil-transmitted helminthias and belongs to the group of neglected tropical diseases, affecting about 604 million people globally.[3]"ORF-PARAVACCINIA VIRUS,NOROVIRUS,"Norovirus, sometimes known as the winter vomiting bug[1] in the UK, is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans. It affects people of all ages.[2] The virus is transmitted by fecally contaminated food or water, by person-to-person contact,[3] and via aerosolization of the virus and subsequent contamination of surfaces.[4] The virus affects around 267 million people and causes over 200,000 deaths each year; these deaths are usually in less developed countries and in the very young, elderly and immunosuppressed.[5]Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, projectile vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, and low-grade fever may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous and most who contract it make a full recovery within a couple of days.[1] Norovirus is rapidly inactivated by either sufficient heating or by chlorine-based disinfectants and polyquaternary amines, but the virus is less susceptible to alcohols and detergents.[6]After infection, immunity to norovirus is usually incomplete and temporary,[7] with one publication drawing the conclusion that protective immunity to the same strain of norovirus lasts for six months, but that all such immunity is gone after two years.[8] Outbreaks of norovirus infection often occur in closed or semiclosed communities, such as long-term care facilities, overnight camps, hospitals, schools, prisons, dormitories, and cruise ships, where the infection spreads very rapidly either by person-to-person transmission or through contaminated food.[9] Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by one infected person.[10]The genus name Norovirus is derived from Norwalk virus, the only species of the genus. The species causes approximately 90% of epidemic nonbacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world,[11] and may be responsible for 50% of all foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the United States.[12][13]"PEPTOSTREPTOCOCCUS,"Peptostreptococcus is a genus of anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore forming bacteria. The cells are small, spherical, and can occur in short chains, in pairs or individually.[1] Peptostreptococcus are slow-growing bacteria with increasing resistance to antimicrobial drugs.[2]The most frequently identified species of Peptostreptococcus is P. magnus."ISOSPORA,"Isospora is a genus of internal parasites classified under Coccidia.It is responsible for the condition isosporiasis, which causes acute, non-bloody diarrhoea in immunocompromised individuals."SCHISTOSOMA,"A genus of trematodes, Schistosoma, commonly known as blood-flukes, are parasitic flatworms responsible for a highly significant group of infections in humans termed schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is considered by the World Health Organization as the second most socioeconomically devastating parasitic disease, (after malaria), with hundreds of millions infected worldwide.[1][2]Adult flatworms parasitize blood capillaries of either the mesenteries or plexus of the bladder, depending on the infecting species. They are unique among trematodes and any other flatworms in that they are dioecious with distinct sexual dimorphism between male and female. Thousands of eggs are released and reach either the bladder or the intestine (according to the infecting species), and these are then excreted in urine or feces to fresh water. Larvae must then pass through an intermediate snail host, before the next larval stage of the parasite emerges that can infect a new mammalian host by directly penetrating the skin."ASTROVIRUS,"Astrovirus is a type of virus that was first discovered in 1975 using electron microscopes following an outbreak of diarrhoea in humans.[1] In addition to humans, astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species (and are classified as genus Mammoastrovirus) and from avian species such as ducks, chickens, and turkey poults (classified as genus Aviastrovirus). Astroviruses are 28_35 nm diameter, icosahedral viruses that have a characteristic five- or sixpointed star-like surface structure when viewed by electron microscopy. Along with the Picornaviridae and the Caliciviridae, the Astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus-sense, single-stranded RNA.[2] Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid.[3] Human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies to be an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide.[2]"COXIELLA,"Coxiella refers to a genus of Gram-negative bacteria in the family Coxiellaceae. It is named after Harold Herald Rea Cox (1907_1986), an American bacteriologist. It is one of the Gammaproteobacteria.[1]Coxiella burnetii is the only member of this genus. It is an intracellular bacterium and it survives within the phagolysosomes of its host. It causes Q fever.Treatment: 1st Generation cephalosporin"VIBRIO,"Vibrio is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria possessing a curved-rod shape (comma shape),[1][2][3] several species of which can cause foodborne infection, usually associated with eating undercooked seafood. Typically found in salt water, Vibrio species are facultative anaerobes that test positive for oxidase and do not form spores.[4] All members of the genus are motile and have polar flagella with sheaths. Recent phylogenies have been constructed based on a suite of genes (multilocus sequence analysis).[1]The name Vibrio derives from Filippo Pacini, who isolated micro-organisms he called ""vibrions"" from cholera patients in 1854, because of their motility.[5]"PAPOVAVIRUS,"A Papovavirus is any member of the former virus family of Papovaviridae.[1] They are mainly associated with various neoplasms in mammals.[1] The family of Papovaviridae is no longer used in recent taxonomy, but is split into the Papillomaviridae and the Polyomaviridae.[2]The name derives from three abbreviations: Pa for papillomavirus, Po for polyomavirus, and Va for ""vacuolating"" (simian vacuolating virus 40 or SV40, which is now known to be part of the polyomavirus genus).Papovaviruses are DNA viruses containing double-stranded DNA, are icosahedral in shape, and do not have a lipoprotein envelope.They are commonly found in humans and other species, mostly mammals. The one that most often causes disease in humans is the human papillomavirus."ACINETOBACTER,"Acinetobacter (a-sin-EE-toe-bak-ter) is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the wider class of Gammaproteobacteria. Acinetobacter species are not motile and oxidase-negative, and occur in pairs under magnification.They are important soil organisms, where they contribute to the mineralization of, for example, aromatic compounds. Acinetobacter species are a key source of infection in debilitated patients in the hospital, in particular the species Acinetobacter baumannii."SERRATIA,"Serratia is a genus of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The most common species in the genus, S. marcescens, is normally the only pathogen and usually causes nosocomial infections. However, rare strains of S. plymuthica, S. liquefaciens, S. rubidaea, and S. odoriferae have caused diseases through infection.[2] Members of this genus produce characteristic red pigment, prodigiosin, and can be distinguished from other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae by their unique production of three enzymes: DNase, lipase, and gelatinase.[3]"LEPTOSPIRA,"Leptospira (Greek leptos, ""fine, thin"" and Latin spira, ""coil"")[1] is a genus of spirochaete bacteria, including a small number of pathogenic and saprophytic species.[2] Leptospira was first observed in 1907 in kidney tissue slices of a leptospirosis victim who was described as having died of ""yellow fever.""[3]"BORDETELLA,"Bordetella is a genus of small (0.2 - 0.7 micrometres), Gram-negative coccobacilli of the phylum Proteobacteria. Bordetella species, with the exception of B. petrii, are obligate aerobes, as well as highly fastidious, or difficult to culture. Three species are human pathogens (B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. bronchiseptica); one of these (B. bronchiseptica) is also motile.[1]B. pertussis and occasionally B. parapertussis cause pertussis or whooping cough in humans, and some B. parapertussis strains can colonise sheep. B. bronchiseptica rarely infects healthy humans, though disease in immunocompromised patients has been reported.[2] B. bronchiseptica causes several diseases in other mammals, including kennel cough and atrophic rhinitis in dogs and pigs, respectively. Other members of the genus cause similar diseases in other mammals, and in birds (B. hinzii, B. avium).The Bordetella genus is named after Jules Bordet."PROVIDENCIA,"Providencia is a Gram negative, motile bacterium of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Some strains (P. stuartii, for example) are opportunistic pathogens in humans and can cause urinary tract infections, particularly in patients with long-term indwelling urinary catheters or extensive severe burns. Other strains (for example P. burhodogranariea and P. sneebia) are found in the haemolymph of Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies.[1]Some strains are sensitive to ampicillin."GARDNERELLA,"Gardnerella is a genus of Gram-variable-staining facultative anaerobic bacteria of which G. vaginalis is the only species. The organisms are small (1-1.5 micrometer diameter) non-spore forming, non-motile coccobacilli.Once classified as Haemophilus vaginalis and afterwards as Corynebacterium vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis grows as small, circular, convex, gray colonies on chocolate agar; it also grows on HBT agar. A selective medium for G. vaginalis is colistin-oxolinic acid blood agar."STRONGYLOIDES,"Strongyloides (from Greek strongylos, round, + eidos, resemblance), Anguillula, or threadworm is a genus of small nematode parasites, belonging to the family Strongyloididae, commonly found in the small intestine of mammals (particularly ruminants), that are characterized by an unusual life cycle that involves one or several generations of free-living adult worms.Human infection, strongyloidiasis, is chiefly caused by Strongyloides stercoralis, widespread in all tropical regions, or by Strongyloides fuelleborni, a parasite of primates in African and Asian tropics and of humans in African tropics and New Guinea. Other species include Strongyloides papillosus found in cows, pigs, sheep, goats, rabbits, and rats, Strongyloides ransomi found in pigs and Strongyloides ratti, found in rats."ADENOVIRUSES,"Adenoviruses (members of the family Adenoviridae) are medium-sized (90_100 nm), nonenveloped (without an outer lipid bilayer) viruses with an icosahedral nucleocapsid containing a double stranded DNA genome. Their name derives from their initial isolation from human adenoids in 1953.[1]They have a broad range of vertebrate hosts; in humans, 57 distinct adenoviral serotypes have been found to cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild respiratory infections in young children to life-threatening multi-organ disease in people with a weakened immune system."STENOTROPHOMONAS,"Stenotrophomonas is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria.[1] With species ranging from common soil organisms (S. nitritireducens) to opportunistic human pathogens (S. maltophilia), the molecular taxonomy of the genus is still somewhat unclear.[2]"HAFNIA,"Hafnia is the genus of the Enterobacteriaceae family whose only species is the Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium Hafnia alvei.H. alvei is a commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract and not normally pathogenic, but may cause disease in immunocompromised patients. It is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, including the aminopenicillins.The name comes from Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen."MICROCOCCUS,"Micrococcus is a genus of bacteria in the Micrococcaceae family. Micrococcus occurs in a wide range of environments, including water, dust, and soil. Micrococci have Gram-positive spherical cells ranging from about 0.5 to 3 micrometers in diameter and typically appear in tetrads. They are catalase positive, oxidase positive, indole negative and citrate negative. Micrococcus has a substantial cell wall, which may comprise as much as 50% of the cell mass. The genome of Micrococcus is rich in guanine and cytosine (GC), typically exhibiting 65 to 75% GC-content. Micrococci often carry plasmids (ranging from 1 to 100 MDa in size) that provide the organism with useful traits."ECHINOCOCCUS,"The genus Echinococcus includes six parasite species of cyclophyllid tapeworms to date, of the family Taeniidae. Infection with Echinococcus results in hydatid disease, also known as echinococcosis.Echinococcus is triploblastic - it has three layers- outermost ectoderm, middle mesoderm, and inner endoderm. An anus is absent, and it has no digestive system. Its body is covered by tegument and the worm is divided into a scolex, a short neck, and three to six proglottids. Its body shape is ribbon-like.In humans, this causes a disease called echinococcosis. The three types of echinococcosis are cystic echinococcosis caused by E. granulosus, alveolar echinococcosis caused by E. multilocularis, and polycystic echinococcosis caused by E. vogeli or E. oligarthrus.[1] A worm'sincubation period is usually long and can be up to 50 years. Cystic echinococcosis is mostly found in South and Central America, Africa, the Middle East, China, Italy, Spain, Greece, Russia, and the western United States (Arizona, New Mexico, and California).Echinococcosis is a zoonosis; humans are dead-end hosts. The definitive hosts are carnivorous predators - dogs, wolves, foxes, and lions. The adult tapeworm lives in their small intestines and delivers eggs to be excreted with the stool. The intermediate hosts are infected by ingesting eggs. Sheep, goats, cattle, camels, pigs, wild herbivores, and rodents are the usual intermediate hosts, but humans can also be infected.The egg hatches in the digestive system of the intermediate host, producing a planula larva. It penetrates the intestinal wall and is carried by bloodstream to liver, lung, brain, or another organ. It settles there and turns into a bladder-like structure called hydatid cyst. From the inner lining of its wall, protoscoleces (i.e. scoleces with invaginated tissue layers) bud and protrude into the fluid filling the cyst.After the death of the normal intermediate host, its body can be eaten by carnivores suitable as definitive hosts. In their small intestines, protoscoleces turn inside out, attach, and give rise to adult tapeworms, completing the lifecycle. In humans, the cysts persist and grow for years. They are regularly found in the liver (and every possible organ: spleen, kidney, bone, brain, tongue and skin) and are asymptomatic until their growing size produces symptoms or are accidentally discovered. Disruption of the cysts (spontaneous or iatrogenic e.g. liver biopsy) can be life-threatening due to anaphylactic shock.Cysts are detected with ultrasound, X-ray computed tomography, or other imaging techniques. Antiechinococcus antibodies can be detected with serodiagnostic tests - indirect fluorescent antibody, complement fixation, ELISA, Western blot, and other methods.[2]"COLIFORM,"Coliform bacteria are a commonly used bacterial indicator of sanitary quality of foods and water. They are defined as rod-shaped Gram-negative non-spore forming and motile or non-motile bacteria which can ferment lactose with the production of acid and gas when incubated at 35-37 degrees C.[1] Coliforms can be found in the aquatic environment, in soil and on vegetation; they are universally present in large numbers in the feces of warm-blooded animals. While coliforms themselves are not normally causes of serious illness, they are easy to culture, and their presence is used to indicate that other pathogenic organisms of fecal origin may be present. Such pathogens include disease-causing bacteria, viruses, or protozoa and many multicellular parasites. Coliform procedures are performed in aerobic or reduced oxygen conditions.Typical genera include:[2]Citrobacter,EnterobacterHafniaKlebsiellaFecal coliform:EscherichiaEscherichia coli (E. coli), a rod-shaped member of the coliform group, can be distinguished from most other coliforms by its ability to ferment lactose at 44 degrees C in the fecal coliform test, and by its growth and color reaction on certain types of culture media. When cultured on an eosin methylene blue (EMB) plate, a positive result for E. coli is metallic green colonies on a dark purple media. Escherichia coli have an incubation period of 12-72 hours with the optimal growth temperature being 30-37 degrees C. Unlike the general coliform group, E. coli are almost exclusively of fecal origin and their presence is thus an effective confirmation of fecal contamination. Most strains of E. coli are harmless, but some can cause serious illness in humans. Infection symptoms and signs include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting and occasionally, fever. The bacteria can also cause pneumonia, other respiratory illnesses and urinary tract infections.[3][4]An easy way to differentiate between different types of coliform bacteria is by using an Eosin Methylene Blue Agar plate. This plate is partially inhibitory to Gram (+) bacteria, and will produce a color change in the Gram (-) bacterial colonies based on lactose fermentation abilities. Strong lactose fermenters will appear as dark blue/purple/black, and E.coli (which also ferments lactose) colonies will be dark colored, but will also appear to have a metallic green sheen. Other coliform bacteria will appear as thick, slimy colonies, with non-fermenters being colorless, and weak fermenters being pink."HELICOBACTER,"Helicobacter is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria possessing a characteristic helical shape. They were initially considered to be members of the Campylobacter genus, but in 1989 Goodwin et al. published sufficient reasons to justify his new genus name of Helicobacter. [1] The Helicobacter genus contains about 35 species.[2][3][4]Some species have been found living in the lining of the upper gastrointestinal tract, as well as the liver of mammals and some birds.[5] The most widely known species of the genus is H. pylori, which infects up to 50% of the human population.[4] Some strains of this bacterium are pathogenic to humans as it is strongly associated with peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis, duodenitis, and stomach cancer. It also serves as the type species of the genus.Helicobacter species are able to thrive in the very acidic mammalian stomach by producing large quantities of the enzyme urease, which locally raises the pH from about 2 to a more biocompatible range of 6 to 7.[6] Bacteria belonging to this genus are usually susceptible to antibiotics such as penicillin, are microaerophilic (optimal oxygen concentration between 5 and 14%) capnophiles, and are fast-moving with their flagella.[7][8]"BORRELIA,"Borrelia is a genus of bacteria of the spirochete phylum.[1] It causes borreliosis, a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by ticks and some by lice, depending on the species.[2] The 36 known species of Borrelia are named after the French biologist Am_d_e Borrel."TRICHOSPORON,"Trichosporon is a genus of anamorphic fungi in the family Trichosporonaceae. All species of Trichosporon are yeasts with no known teleomorphs (sexual states). Most are typically isolated from soil, but several species occur as a natural part of the skin microbiota of humans and other animals. Proliferation of Trichosporon yeasts in the hair can lead to an unpleasant but non-serious condition known as white piedra. Trichosporon species can also cause severe opportunistic infections (trichosporonosis) in immunocompromised individuals."BLASTOCYSTIS,"Blastocystis is a genus of single-celled protozoan parasites belonging to a group of organisms known as the Stramenopiles (also called Heterokonts) that includes algae, diatoms, and water molds. Blastocystis comprises several species, living in the gastrointestinal tracts of species as diverse as humans, farm animals, birds, rodents, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and cockroaches.[1]Blastocystis exhibits low host specificity, and many different species of Blastocystis can infect humans[2] and by current convention, any of these species would be identified as Blastocystis hominis if they were identified in a human. These have a widespread geographic distribution and are found at a rate of 5-10% in most developed countries, and a rate of up to 50% in less developed areas.[3] High rates of infection are also found in individuals in developed countries who work with animals.[4] Although the role of Blastocystis hominis in human disease is often referred to as controversial, a systematic survey of research studies conducted by 11 infectious disease specialists from nine countries, found that over 95% of papers published in the last 10 years identified it as causing illness in immunocompetent individuals. The paper attributed confusion over pathogenicity to the existence of asymptomatic carriers, a phenomenon the study noted is common to all gastrointestinal protozoa.[3]"HEPATITIS VIRUSES,"Viral hepatitis is liver inflammation due to a viral infection.[1] It may present in acute (recent infection, relatively rapid onset) or chronic forms. The most common causes of viral hepatitis are the five unrelated hepatotropic viruses Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis D, and Hepatitis E. In addition to the nominal hepatitis viruses, other viruses that can also cause liver inflammation include Herpes simplex, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein_Barr virus, and Yellow fever."AEROCOCCUS,"Aerococcus is a genus in the phylum Firmicutes (Bacteria).[1] It includes the causative agent of gaffkaemia, a disease of lobsters.[2]"PANTOEA,"Pantoea is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, recently separated from the Enterobacter genus. Pantoea bacteria ferment lactose, are motile, and form mucoid colonies. [1] This genus includes eight species and two sub-species. Besides that, some of the species show quorum sensing ability that could drive different gene expression hence controlling certain physiological activities [2]"ENTEROBIUS,"The pinworm (genus Enterobius), also known as threadworm (in the United Kingdom and Australia) or seatworm, is a parasitic worm. It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common intestinal parasite or helminth, especially in humans.[5] The medical condition associated with pinworm infestation is known as enterobiasis[6] (a type of helminthiasis) or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae.[7]Throughout this article, the word ""pinworm"" refers to Enterobius. In British usage, however, pinworm refers to Strongyloides, while Enterobius is called threadworm.[8]"PREVOTELLA,"Prevotella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria.Bacteroides melaninogenicus has been reclassified and split into Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella intermedia.[1]Prevotella spp. are members of the oral and vaginal flora, and are recovered from anaerobic infections of the respiratory tract. These infections include aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, pulmonary empyema, and chronic otitis media and sinusitis. They have been isolated from abscesses and burns in the vicinity of the mouth, bites, paronychia, urinary tract infection, brain abscesses, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia associated with upper respiratory tract infections. Prevotella spp. predominate in periodontal disease and periodontal abscesses. [2]In a study of gut bacteria of children in Burkina Faso (in Africa), Prevotella made up 53% of the gut bacteria, but were absent in age-matched European children.[3] Studies also indicate that long-term diet is strongly associated with the gut microbiome composition those who eat plenty of protein and animal fats typical of Western diet have predominantly Bacteroides bacteria, while for those who consume more carbohydrates, especially fibre, the Prevotella species dominate.[4]P. copri is possibly connected to rheumatoid arthritis.[5]A recent study on Prevotella derived from humans compared the gene repertoires of its species derived from different body sites of human. It also reported an open pan- genome showing vast diversity of gene pool. [6]"LACTOCOCCUS,"Lactococcus is a genus of lactic acid bacteria that were formerly included in the genus Streptococcus Group N1.[1] They are known as homofermentors meaning that they produce a single product, lactic acid in this case, as the major or only product of glucose fermentation. Their homofermentative character can be altered by adjusting cultural conditions such as pH, glucose concentration, and nutrient limitation. They are gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-motile cocci that are found singly, in pairs, or in chains. The genus contains strains known to grow at or below 7 degrees C.[2]Nine species of Lactococcus are currently recognized along with four subspecies.[3] They are:L. chungangensisL. formosensisL. fujiensisL. garvieaeL. lactisL. lactis subsp. cremorisL. lactis subsp. hordniaeL. lactis subsp. lactisL. lactis subsp. tructaeL. pisciumL. plantarumL. raffinolactisL. taiwanensisThese organisms are commonly used in the dairy industry in the manufacture of fermented dairy products such as cheeses. They can be used in single-strain starter cultures, or in mixed-strain cultures with other lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Streptococcus. Special interest is placed on the study of L. lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, as they are the strains used as starter cultures in industrial dairy fermentations.[4] Their main purpose in dairy production is the rapid acidification of milk; this causes a drop in the pH of the fermented product, which prevents the growth of spoilage bacteria. The bacteria also play a role in the flavor of the final product.[5] Lactococci are currently being used in the biotechnology industry. They are easily grown at industrial scale on whey-based media. As food-grade bacteria, they are used in the production of foreign proteins that are applied to the food industry."TRICHOPHYTON,"Trichophyton is a genus of fungi, which includes the parasitic varieties that cause tinea, including athlete's foot, ringworm, jock itch, and similar infections of the nail, beard, skin and scalp. Trichophyton fungi are molds characterized by the development of both smooth-walled macro- and microconidia. Macroconidia are mostly borne laterally directly on the hyphae or on short pedicels, and are thin- or thick-walled, clavate to fusiform, and range from 4 to 8 by 8 to 50 _m in size. Macroconidia are few or absent in many species. Microconidia are spherical, pyriform to clavate or of irregular shape, and range from 2 to 3 by 2 to 4 _m in size."ARCANOBACTERIUM,"Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, formerly known as Corynebacterium h_molyticum, is a bacterium classified as a Gram-positive bacillus and is catalase-negative, aerobic, beta-haemolytic, nonmotile.[1] It is part of the normal flora of the pharynx, but may cause head and neck infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.[2]"DIENTAMOEBA,"Dientamoeba fragilis is a single-celled parasite found in the gastrointestinal tract of some humans, pigs and gorillas. It causes gastrointestinal upset in some people, but not in others.[1] It is an important cause of travellers diarrhoea, chronic diarrhoea, fatigue and, in children, failure to thrive."RHIZOBIUM,"Rhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen. Rhizobium forms an endosymbiotic nitrogen fixing association with roots of legumes and Parasponia.The bacteria colonize plant cells within root nodules; here the bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia and then provide organic nitrogenous compounds such as glutamine or ureides to the plant. The plant provides the bacteria with organic compounds made by photosynthesis.[2]"MORAXELLA,"Moraxella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria in the Moraxellaceae family. It is named after the Swiss ophthalmologist Victor Morax. The organisms are short rods, coccobacilli or, as in the case of Moraxella catarrhalis, diplococci in morphology, with asaccharolytic, oxidase-positive and catalase-positive properties.[2] Moraxella catarrhalis is the clinically most important species under this genus."FLAVOBACTERIUM,"Flaviobacterium is a genus of Gram-negative, non-motile and motile, rod-shaped bacteria that consists of 130 recognized species (http://www.bacterio.net/flavobacterium.html),[1] as well as three newly proposed species (F. gondwanense,[2] F. salegens,[2] and F. scophthalmum[3]). Flavobacteria are found in soil and fresh water in a variety of environments. Several species are known to cause disease in freshwater fish.[4]Flaviobacterium psychrophilum causes the bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) on salmonids and the rainbow trout fry disease (RTFS) on rainbow trouts. Flaviobacterium columnare causes the cotton-wool disease on freshwater fishes. Flaviobacterium branchiophilum causes the bacterial gill disease (BGD) on trouts."DELFTIA,Delftia is a genus of Comamonad bacteria.BACILLUS,"Bacillus is a genus of Gram-positive, rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria and a member of the phylum Firmicutes. Bacillus species can be obligate aerobes (oxygen reliant), or facultative anaerobes (having the ability to be aerobic or anaerobic). They will test positive for the enzyme catalase when there has been oxygen used or present.[2] Ubiquitous in nature, Bacillus includes both free-living (nonparasitic) and parasitic pathogenic species. Under stressful environmental conditions, the bacteria can produce oval endospores that are not true 'spores', but to which the bacteria can reduce themselves and remain in a dormant state for very long periods. These characteristics originally defined the genus, but not all such species are closely related, and many have been moved to other genera of the Firmicutes.[3]Many species of Bacillus can produce copious amounts of enzymes which are made use of in different industries. Some species can form intracellular inclusions of polyhydroxyalkanoates under certain adverse environmental conditions, as in a lack of elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources.B.subtilis has proved a valuable model for research. Other species of Bacillus are important pathogens, causing anthrax and food poisoning."MICROSPORIDIA,"The microsporidia constitute a phylum (Microspora) of spore-forming unicellular parasites. They were once thought to be protists but are now known to be fungi. Loosely 1500 of the probably more than one million[citation needed] species are named now. Microsporidia are restricted to animal hosts, and all major groups of animals host microsporidia. Most infect insects, but they are also responsible for common diseases of crustaceans and fish. The named species of microsporidia usually infect one host species or a group of closely related taxa. Several species, most of which are opportunistic, also infect humans.Approximately 10 percent of the species are parasites of vertebrates   including humans, in which they can cause microsporidiosis.After infection they influence their hosts in various ways and all organs and tissues are invaded, though generally by different species of microsporidia. Some species are lethal, and a few are used in biological control of insect pests. Parasitic castration, gigantism, or change of host sex are all potential effects of microsporidian parasitism (in insects). In the most advanced cases of parasitism the microsporidium rules the host cell completely and controls its metabolism and reproduction, forming a xenoma. .[1]Replication takes place within the host's cells, which are infected by means of unicellular spores. These vary from 1-40 _m, making them some of the smallest eukaryotes.[citation needed] Microsporidia that infect mammals are 1.0-4.0 _m.[2] They also have the smallest eukaryotic genomes.Microsporidium was once the vernacular name for a member of the class Microsporidea in the protozoan subphylum Cnidospora.[3]"SALMONELLA,"Salmonella is a genus of rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family. There are two species of Salmonella, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica. Salmonella enterica is further divided into six subspecies and over 2500 serovars.Salmonellae are found worldwide in both cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals, and in the environment. Strains of Salmonella cause illnesses such as typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and food poisoning (Salmonellosis).[1]"CALICIVIRUS,"Caliciviridae is a family of viruses, members of Class IV of the Baltimore scheme. They are positive-sense, single stranded RNA which is non-segmented. There are currently seven species in this family, divided among 5 genera. Diseases associated with this family include: feline calicivirus: respiratory disease; rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus: often-fatal hemorrhages; norwalk group of viruses: gastroenteritis.[1][2] Caliciviruses naturally infect vertebrates, and have been found in a number of organisms such as humans, cattle, pigs, cats, chickens, reptiles, dolphins and amphibians. The caliciviruses have a simple construction and are not enveloped. The capsid appears hexagonal/spherical and has icosahedral symmetry (T=1 or T=3[1]) with a diameter of 35_39 nm.[3]Caliciviruses are not very well studied because until recently they could not be grown in culture, and there is no suitable animal model. However, the recent application of modern genomic technologies has led to an increased understanding of the virus family.[3] A recent isolate from rhesus monkeys Tulane virus can be grown in culture and this system promises to increase our understanding of these viruses.[4]The name calicivirus is derived from the Greek word calyx meaning cup or goblet. This name is appropriate as many strains have visible cup-shaped depressions."AGGREGATIBACTER,"Aggregatibacter is a genus in the phylum Proteobacteria (Bacteria), which contains three species, namely:A. actinomycetemcomitans ( (Klinger 1912) Nrskov-Lauritsen and Kilian 2006, (type species of the genus); Greek noun aktis, aktinos (_____, _______), a beam; Greek muk_s -_tos, mushroom or other fungus; New Latin actinomyces -etis, an actinomycete; Latin comitans, accompanying; New Latin actinomycetemcomitans, accompanying an actinomycete)[1]A. aphrophilus (Khairat 1940) Nrskov-Lauritsen and Kilian 2006, Ancient Greek aphros, foam; New Latin philus from Greek philos (_____) meaning friend, loving; New Latin aphrophilus, foam-loving)[2]A. segnis (Kilian 1977) Nrskov-Lauritsen and Kilian 2006,Latin segnis, slow, sluggish, inactive)[3]"TAENIA,"Taenia is a genus of tapeworms (a type of helminth) that includes some important parasites of livestock. Members of the genus are responsible for taeniasis and cysticercosis in humans, which are a type of helminthiasis belonging to the group of neglected tropical diseases. More than 100 species are recorded. They are morphologically characterized by a ribbon-like body composed of a series of segments called proglottids; hence the name Taenia (Greek tainia meaning ribbon, bandage, or stripe). The anterior end of the body is the scolex. Not all members of the genus Taenia have an armed scolex (hooks and/or spines located in the ""head"" region), for example, Taenia saginata has an unarmed scolex, while Taenia solium has an armed scolex.[1]Proglottids have a central ovary, with a vitellarium (yolk gland) posterior to it. As in all cyclophyllid cestodes, a genital pore occurs on the side of the proglottid. Eggs are released when the proglottid deteriorates, so a uterine pore is unnecessary."BRUCELLA,"Brucella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria,[2][3] named after David Bruce (1855-1931). They are small (0.5 to 0.7 by 0.6 to 1.5 micrometresm), non-encapsulated, flagellated,[4] facultatively intracellular coccobacilli.Brucella is the cause of brucellosis, which is a zoonosis. It is transmitted by ingesting contaminated food (such as unpasteurized milk products), direct contact with an infected animal, or inhalation of aerosols. Transmission from human to human, for example through sexual intercourse or from mother to child, is exceedingly rare, but possible.[5] Minimum infectious exposure is between 10 - 100 organisms.The different species of Brucella are genetically very similar, although each has a slightly different host specificity (see below). Hence, the NCBI taxonomy includes most Brucella species under Brucella melitensis.The many names of brucellosis include (human disease/animal disease):Malta fever/Bangs diseaseUndulant fever/enzootic abortionMediterranean fever/epizootic abortionRock fever of Gibraltar/slinking of calvesGastric fever/ram epididymitisContagious abortion/spontaneous abortion[6]"BREVUNDIMONAS,The Brevundimonas are a genus of proteobacteria.CORONAVIRUS,"Coronaviruses are species in the genera of virus belonging to one of two subfamilies Coronavirinae and Torovirinae in the family Coronaviridae, in the order Nidovirales.[1][2] Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome and with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genomic size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, extraordinarily large for an RNA virus.The name ""coronavirus"" is derived from the Latin corona, meaning crown or halo, and refers to the characteristic appearance of virions under electron microscopy (E.M.) with a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of a royal crown or of the solar corona. This morphology is created by the viral spike (S) peplomers, which are proteins that populate the surface of the virus and determine host tropism.Proteins that contribute to the overall structure of all coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In the specific case of the SARS coronavirus (see below), a defined receptor-binding domain on S mediates the attachment of the virus to its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).[3] Some coronaviruses (specifically the members of Betacoronavirus subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).[1]"FLAVIVIRUSES,"Flavivirus is a genus of viruses in the family Flaviviridae. This genus includes the West Nile virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, and several other viruses which may cause encephalitis.[2]Flaviviruses are named from the yellow fever virus, the type virus for the family; the word ""flavus"" means ""yellow"" in Latin. The name ""yellow fever"" originated from its propensity to cause yellow jaundice in victims.[3]Flaviviruses share several common aspects: common size (40-65 nm), symmetry (enveloped, icosahedral nucleocapsid), nucleic acid (positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 10,000_11,000 bases), and appearance in the electron microscope.Most of these viruses are transmitted by the bite from an infected arthropod (mosquito or tick) and hence, classified as arboviruses. Human infections with these viruses are typically incidental, as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titers to reinfect arthropods needed to continue the virus life cycle _ man is a dead end host. The exceptions to this are yellow fever and dengue viruses, which still require mosquito vectors, but are well-enough adapted to humans as to not necessarily depend upon animal hosts (although both continue to have important animal transmission routes as well).Other virus transmission routes for arboviruses include handling infected animal carcasses, blood transfusion, child birth and through consumption of unpasteurised milk products. The transmission from animals to humans without an intermediate vector arthropod is thought to be unlikely. For example, early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not contagious.The known non-arboviruses of the flavivirus family either reproduce in arthropods or vertebrates, but not both."MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS CLINICAL WITH NO ORGANISM,CAPNOCYTOPHAGA,"Capnocytophaga is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. Normally found in the oropharyngeal tract of mammals, they are involved in the pathogenesis of some animal bite wounds as well as periodontal diseases.[1]Capnocytophaga canimorsus transmission following a dog bite can cause overwhelming sepsis in asplenic patients, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Empiric treatment for this bacteria following a dog bite, consisting of a third-generation cephalosporin early in the infection, should be instituted in these patient populations, or following deep bites or dog bites to the hand."NOCARDIA,BURKHOLDERIA,ALCALIGENES,ENDOLIMAX,GEMELLA,CRYPTOCOCCUS,UREAPLASMA,FILARIA,HYMENOLEPIS,FUSOBACTERIUM,IODAMOEBA,CYCLOSPORA,CHRYSEOBACTERIUM,PEPTOCOCCUS,LACTOBACILLUS,PROPIONIBACTERIUM,TRICHOMONAS,EUBACTERIUM,MYCOCLADUS,TOXOCARA,LEISHMANIA,OCHROBACTRUM,MALASSEZIA,CHRYSEOMONAS,LEPTOTRICHIA,MICROSPORUM,KLUYVERA,MOLLUSCUM CONTAGIOSUM VIRUS,LEUCONOSTOC,ACREMONIUM,SCOPULARIOPSIS,ERYSIPELOTHRIX,NEW ORGANISM,GRANULICATELLA,SPHINGOBACTERIUM,RALSTONIA,POLYOMAVIRUS,SHEWANELLA,COMAMONAS,PAPILLOMAVIRUS,LEGIONELLA,PORPHYROMONAS,BARTONELLA,ACHROMOBACTER,LOUSE,TREPONEMA,RICKETTSIA,PENICILLIUM,DIPTERA,TICK,SACCHAROMYCES,RHIZOPUS,SMALL ROUND VIRUS,RHODOTORULA,ROTHIA,FLEA,FUSARIUM,RAOULTELLA,BREVIBACTERIUM,EGGERTHELLA,ARBOVIRUSES,OLIGELLA,CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS,RHODOCOCCUS,ABIOTROPHIA,TRYPANOSOMA,ALTERNARIA,EIKENELLA,DIALISTER,SCEDOSPORIUM,RAHNELLA,ANAEROBIOSPIRILLUM,ANAEROCOCCUS,PARECHOVIRUS,HUMAN METAPNEUMOVIRUS (HMPV),CHRYSOSPORIUM,DIPHYLLOBOTHRIUM,CAT SCRATCH FEVER,EPIDERMOPHYTON,EXOPHIALA,PHOMA,BABESIA,PAECILOMYCES,ACTINOBACULUM,DERMABACTER,PARAGONIMUS,MYROIDES,HELMINTHS OTHER NAMED,MITE,GLOBICATELLA,EWINGELLA,CUNNINGAMELLA,BOCAVIRUS,CHAETOMIUM,ULOCLADIUM,STOMATOCOCCUS,ROSEOMONAS,ANCYLOSTOMA,ERWINIA,EMPEDOBACTER,FASCIOLA,BRANHAMELLA,WEEKSELLA,BIFIDOBACTERIUM,STREPTOMYCES,CLONORCHIS,EDWARDSIELLA,NEOSCYTALIDIUM,HISTOPLASMA,PEDIOCOCCUS,LECLERCIA,COCCIDIOIDES,AGROBACTERIUM,SPHINGOMONAS,ARTHROBACTER,GEOTRICHUM,SPOROTHRIX,ACTINOBACILLUS,JAKOB-CREUTZFELD AGENT,INQUILINUS,PAENIBACILLUS,PHAEOSPHAERIA,KOCURIA,CARDIOBACTERIUM,CHROMOBACTERIUM,TRICHODERMA,PHIALOPHORA,MOBILUNCUS,ACANTHAMOEBA,PSYCHROBACTER,STREPTOBACILLUS,PSEUDALLESCHERIA,PARACOCCIDIOIDES,MUCOR,RHIZOMUCOR,MICROBACTERIUM,MICROPOLYSPORA,CALYMMATOBACTERIUM,KURTHIA,ARCOBACTER,BIPOLARIS,BUNYAVIRIDAE,MADURELLA,ABSIDIA,PEPTONIPHILUS,CLADOSPORIUM,CLADOPHIALOPHORA,DICROCOELIUM,CEDECEA,AVIAN ANTIGEN,TRUEPERELLA,OERSKOVIA,NAEGLERIA,HYPHOZYMA,SAGENOMELLA,NECATOR,FACKLAMIA,PANDORAEA,PARVIMONAS,DIPYLIDIUM,LOUPING ILL,NEMATODES UNSPECIFIED,AURANTIMONAS,SNEATHIA,ARACHNIA,SUTTONELLA,DIROFILARIA,COWPOX,BLASTOSCHIZOMYCES,ELIZABETHKINGIA,CAPILLARIA,AZOSPIRILLUM,RUMINOCOCCUS,SACCHAROPOLYSPORA,PICHIA,RABIES CLINICAL WITH NO ORGANISM,SANDFLY FEVER VIRUS,TROPHERYMA,BERGEYELLA,ACTINOMYCETES,NIGROSPORA,FRANCISELLA,SLACKIA,CELLULOMONAS,HELCOCOCCUS,TETANUS CLINICAL WITH NO ORGANISM,CHILOMASTIX,ROBINSONIELLA,TREMATODES,SPOROTRICHUM,BUTTIAUXELLA,ALLOIOCOCCUS,DESULFOVIBRIO,GNATHOSTOMA,BOTRYTIS,LEMINORELLA,DERMACENTOR,PHIALEMONIUM,GORDONIA,VAGOCOCCUS,OSCILLOSPIRA,AUREOBASIDIUM,LECYTHOPHORA,WEISSELLA,JANIBACTER,MOELLERELLA,KLOECKERA,WOLINELLA,VACCINIA VIRUS,FLAVONIFRACTOR,VAHLKAMPFIA,TRICHINELLA,ONYCHOCOLA,DF-2 (CDC GROUP),BLASTOMYCES,PSEUDOCLAVIBACTER,SOLOBACTERIUM,PARALYTIC SHELLFISH POISONING,EHRLICHIA,ACIDOVORAX,BREVIBACILLUS,JANTHINOBACTERIUM,BUTYRIBACTERIUM,PARABACTEROIDES,LUTEIMONAS,COLLINSELLA,ARGASIDAE,SAKSENAEA,VERTICILLIUM,BILOPHILA,HARTMANNELLA,PARACOCCUS,CRONOBACTER,DRACUNCULUS,ALISTIPES,PROTOTHECA,ATOPOBIUM,CUPRIAVIDUS,BALANTIDIUM,MYCOLEPTODISCUS,RHINOCLADIELLA,ENGYDONTIUM,KOSERELLA,CIGUATERA FISH POISONING,
