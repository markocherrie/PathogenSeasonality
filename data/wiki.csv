The best-known species is the pathogenic Absidia corymbifera, which causes zygomycosis, especially in the form of mycotic spontaneous abortion in cows. It can also cause mucormycosis in humans. It is an allergenic that could cause mucorosis in individuals with low immunity. It usually infects the lungs, nose, brain, eyesight and skin. Absidia spp. are ubiquitous in most environments. They are often associated with warm decaying plant matter, such as in compost heaps."ACANTHAMOEBA,"Acanthamoeba is a genus of amoebae, one of the most common protozoa in soil, and frequently found in fresh water and other habitats. The cells are small, usually 15 - 35 micrometres in length and oval to triangular in shape when moving. Acanthamoeba is able to form metabolically inactive cysts which are resistant to fluctuations in temperature and pH levels. Cysts are also resistant to attack by the host immune system and facilitate the recurrence of infection. Most species are free-living bacterivores, but some are opportunists that can cause infections in humans and other animals."ACHROMOBACTER,"Achromobacter is a genus of bacteria, included in the family Alcaligenaceae in the order Burkholderiales. The cells are Gram-negative straight rods and are motile by using one to 20 peritrichous agella. They are strictly aerobic and are found in water (fresh and marine) and soils.[1] They have also been identified as a contaminant in laboratory cell cultures."ACIDOVORAX,The Acidovorax are a genus of Proteobacteria. All species are Facultative. A. avenae causes bacterial fruit blotch on cucurbit crops.[1]ACINETOBACTER,"Acinetobacter (a-sin-EE-toe-bak-ter) is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the wider class of Gammaproteobacteria. Acinetobacter species are not motile and oxidase-negative, and occur in pairs under magnification.They are important soil organisms, where they contribute to the mineralization of, for example, aromatic compounds. Acinetobacter species are a key source of infection in debilitated patients in the hospital, in particular the species Acinetobacter baumannii."ACREMONIUM,"Acremonium is a genus of fungi in the family Hypocreaceae; it used to be known as ""Cephalosporium""."ACTINOBACILLUS,"Actinobacillus is a genus of Gram-negative, immotile and nonspore-forming, oval to rod-shaped bacteria occurring as parasites or pathogens in mammals, birds, and reptiles.[1] It is a member of the Pasteurellaceae family.[2] The bacteria are facultatively aerobic or anaerobic, capable of fermenting carbohydrates (without production of gas), and of reducing nitrates. The genomic DNA contains between 40 and 47 mol % guanine plus cytosine.Actinobacillus (Pasteurella) ureae and A. hominis occur in the respiratory tracts of healthy humans and may be involved in the pathogenesis of sinusitis, bronchopneumonia, and meningitis. A. actinomycetemcomitans occurs in the human oral microflora,[3] and together with anaerobic or capnophilic organisms (HACEK group organisms) may cause endocarditis. Actinobacilli are susceptible to most antibiotics of the beta-lactam family, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and many other antibacterial chemotherapeutics.An analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans indicated it was monophyletic with Haemophilus aphrophilus and H. segnis, and it was proposed that they be reclassified as a new genus, Aggregatibacter (from the Latin, ""aggregare"", meaning ""to come together"").[4][5]"ACTINOBACULUM,Actinobaculum is a genus in the phylum Actinobacteria (Bacteria).[1]ACTINOMYCES,"Actinomyces (from Greek ""actis"" ray, beam and ""mykes"", fungus) is a genus of the actinobacteria class of bacteria. They are all gram-positive. Actinomyces are facultatively anaerobic (except A. meyeri, a strict anaerobe). All species grow best under anaerobic conditions. Actinomyces species may form endospores, and, while individual bacteria are rod-shaped, Actinomyces colonies form fungus-like branched networks of hyphae.[1] The aspect of these colonies initially led to the incorrect assumption that the organism was a fungus and to the name ""Actinomyces"" or ray fungus.Actinomyces are known for causing disease in humans, and for the important role they play in soil ecology. They produce a number of enzymes that help degrade organic plant material, lignin, and chitin. As such, their presence is important in the formation of compost. Some species have been found as part of the healthy vaginal microbiota.[2]"ACTINOMYCETES,"Actinobacteria is a phylum of Gram-positive bacteria with high guanine and cytosine content in their DNA.[1] The G+C content of Actinobacteria can be as high as 70%, though some may have a low G+C content.[2] They can be terrestrial or aquatic.[3] Although understood primarily as soil bacteria, they might be more abundant in freshwaters.[4] Actinobacteria is one of the dominant bacterial phyla and contains one of the largest of bacterial genera, Streptomyces.[5] Analysis of glutamine synthetase sequence has been suggested for phylogenetic analysis of Actinobacteria.[6]Although some of the largest and most complex bacterial cells belong to the Actinobacteria, the group of marine Actinomarinales has been described as possessing the smallest free-living prokaryotic cells.[7]"ADENOVIRUSES,"Adenoviruses (members of the family Adenoviridae) are medium-sized (90-100 nm), nonenveloped (without an outer lipid bilayer) viruses with an icosahedral nucleocapsid containing a double stranded DNA genome. Their name derives from their initial isolation from human adenoids in 1953.[1]They have a broad range of vertebrate hosts; in humans, 57 distinct adenoviral serotypes have been found to cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild respiratory infections in young children to life-threatening multi-organ disease in people with a weakened immune system."AEROCOCCUS,"Aerococcus is a genus in the phylum Firmicutes (Bacteria).[1] It includes the causative agent of gaffkaemia, a disease of lobsters.[2]"AEROMONAS,"Aeromonas is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that morphologically resembles members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Most of the 14 described species have been associated with human diseases. The most important pathogens are A. hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. veronii biovar sobria. The organisms are ubiquitous in fresh and brackish water. [1]They group with the gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria.[2]Two major diseases associated with Aeromonas are gastroenteritis and wound infections, with or without bacteremia. Gastroenteritis typically occurs after the ingestion of contaminated water or food, whereas wound infections result from exposure to contaminated water.Although some potential virulence factors (e.g. endotoxins, hemolysins, enterotoxins, adherence factors) have been identified, their precise roles are unknown. Aeromonas species cause:opportunistic systemic disease in immunocompromised patientsdiarrheal disease in otherwise healthy individualswound infections"AGGREGATIBACTER,"Aggregatibacter is a genus in the phylum Proteobacteria (Bacteria), which contains three species, namely:A. actinomycetemcomitans ( (Klinger 1912) Norskov-Lauritsen and Kilian 2006, (type species of the genus); Greek noun aktis, aktinos, a beam; Greek, mushroom or other fungus; New Latin actinomyces -etis, an actinomycete; Latin comitans, accompanying; New Latin actinomycetemcomitans, accompanying an actinomycete)[1]A. aphrophilus (Khairat 1940) Norskov-Lauritsen and Kilian 2006, Ancient Greek aphros, foam; New Latin philus from Greek philosophy meaning friend, loving; New Latin aphrophilus, foam-loving)[2]A. segnis (Kilian 1977) Norskov-Lauritsen and Kilian 2006,Latin segnis, slow, sluggish, inactive)[3]"AGROBACTERIUM,"Agrobacterium is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria established by H. J. Conn that uses horizontal gene transfer to cause tumors in plants. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the most commonly studied species in this genus. Agrobacterium is well known for its ability to transfer DNA between itself and plants, and for this reason it has become an important tool for genetic engineering.The Agrobacterium genus is quite heterogeneous. Recent taxonomic studies have reclassified all of the Agrobacterium species into new genera, such as Ahrensia, Pseudorhodobacter, Ruegeria, and Stappia,[1][2] but most species have been controversially reclassified as Rhizobium species.[3][4][5]"ALCALIGENES,"Alcaligenes is a genus of Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacteria. The species are motile with one or more peritrichous flagella and rarely nonmotile. It is a genus of nonfermenting bacteria (in the family Alcaligenaceae). Additionally, some strains of Alcaligenes are capable of anaerobic respiration, but they must be in the presence of nitrate or nitrite; otherwise, their metabolism is respiratory and never fermentative; The genus does not use carbohydrates. Strains of Alcaligenes (such as A. faecalis) are found mostly in the intestinal tracts of vertebrates, decaying materials, dairy products, water, and soil; they can be isolated from human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and wounds in hospitalized patients with compromised immune systems. They are occasionally the cause of opportunistic infections, including nosocomial septicemia.[1][2]Alcaligenes faecalis causes nosocomial septicemia, arising from contaminated hemodialysis or intravenous fluid, in immunocompromised patients.[3]Alcaligenes species have been used for the industrial production of nonstandard amino acids; A. eutrophus also produces the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate.They are rods, coccal rods, or cocci, sized at about 0.5-1.0 x 0.5-2.6 micrometres. They are obligately aerobic, but some can undergo anaerobic respiration if nitrate is present. They tend to be colorless. They typically occur in the soil and water, and some live in the intestinal tracts of vertebrates. Samples from blood, urine, feces, discharge from ears, spinal fluid, and wounds have produced this type of bacteria. Zoonotic infections from ferrets have been recorded.[4]Alcaligenes species have been increasingly recovered over the past decade from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). An experiment recently examined the frequency of correct identification of Alcaligenes species by microbiology labs affiliated with American CF patient care centers. Most (89%) strains of microbial agents in these tests were correctly identified by the referring laboratories as Alcaligenes xylosoxidans.[5]A. faecalis was isolated in 1896 by Petruschky from stale beer. Several strains of the organism have been found since then. This species is motile, flagellated, slender, slightly curved, not spore-forming, slowly growing, nonfermenting, nonencapsulated, Gram-negative aerobe of the family Alcaligenaceae. This species is most commonly found in the alimentary tract as a harmless saprophyte in 5%-19% of the normal population. Systemic infection with this organism is very uncommon. It has been reported to cause sepsis, meningitis, peritonitis, enteric fever, appendicitis, cystitis, chronic suppurative otitis media, abscesses, arthritis, pneumonitis, and endocarditis. It has been associated with fatal outcomes because these organisms are resistant to commonly used antibiotics.[6]"ALISTIPES,Alistipes is a genus in the phylum Bacteroidetes (Bacteria).[1]ALLOIOCOCCUS,No entryALTERNARIA,"Alternaria is a genus of ascomycete fungi. Alternaria species are known as major plant pathogens. They are also common allergens in humans, growing indoors and causing hay fever or hypersensitivity reactions that sometimes lead to asthma. They readily cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised people such as AIDS patients.There are 299 species in the genus;[1][2] they are ubiquitous in the environment and are a natural part of fungal flora almost everywhere. They are normal agents of decay and decomposition. The spores are airborne and found in the soil and water, as well as indoors and on objects. The club-shaped spores are single or form long chains. They can grow thick colonies which are usually green, black, or gray.[2]At least 20% of agricultural spoilage is caused by Alternaria species; most severe losses may reach up to 80% of yield, though.[2] Many human health disorders can be caused by these fungi, which grow on skin and mucous membranes, including on the eyeballs and within the respiratory tract. Allergies are common, but serious infections are rare, except in people with compromised immune systems. However, species of this fungal genus are often prolific producers of a variety of toxic compounds. The effects most of these compounds have on animal and plant health are not well known. Many species of alternaria modify their secondary metabolites by sulfoconjugation,[3] however the role of this process is not yet understood. The terms alternariosis and alternariatoxicosis are used for disorders in humans and animals caused by a fungus in this genus.Not all Alternaria species are pests and pathogens; some have shown promise as biocontrol agents against invasive plant species. Some species have also been reported as endophytic microorganisms with highly bioactive metabolites."ANAEROBIOSPIRILLUM,"Anaerobiospirillum (or Anaerobiospirillum thomasii) is a gram-negative anaerobic bacteria recognized as human flora in human gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the human feces.[1][2]"ANAEROCOCCUS,No entryANCYLOSTOMA,"Ancylostoma is a genus that includes some species of hookworm.Species include:Ancylostoma braziliense (commonly infects cats, popularly known in Brazil as ""bicho-geografico""),Ancylostoma caninum (commonly infects dogs),Ancylostoma ceylanicum,Ancylostoma duodenale,Ancylostoma pluridentatum (commonly infects sylvatic cats),Ancylostoma tubaeforme (infects cats along with other hosts)."ARACHNIA,No entryARBOVIRUSES,"Arbovirus is a term used to refer to a group of viruses that are transmitted by arthropod vectors. The word arbovirus is an acronym (ARthropod-BOrne virus).[1] Symptoms of arbovirus infection generally occur 3-15 days after exposure to the virus and last 3 or 4 days. The most common clinical features of infection are fever, headache, and malaise, but encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever may also occur.[2] The word tibovirus (TIck-BOrne virus) is sometimes used to describe viruses transmitted by ticks, a superorder within the arthropods.[3]"ARCANOBACTERIUM,"Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, formerly known as Corynebacterium haemolyticum, is a bacterium classified as a Gram-positive bacillus and is catalase-negative, aerobic, beta-haemolytic, nonmotile.[1] It is part of the normal flora of the pharynx, but may cause head and neck infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.[2]"ARCOBACTER,"Arcobacter is a genus of Gram-negative, spiral-shaped bacteria in the epsilonproteobacteria class.[1] It shows an unusually wide range of habitats, and some species can be human and animal pathogens.[1][2] Species of the genus Arcobacter are found in both animal and environmental sources, making it unique among the epsilonproteobacteria.[3] This genus currently consists of five species: A. butzleri, A. cryaerophilus, A. skirrowii, A. nitrofigilis, and A. sulfidicus, although several other potential novel species have recently been described from varying environments.[3][4] Three of these five known species are pathogenic.[4] Members of this genus were first isolated in 1977 from aborted bovine fetuses. They are aerotolerant Campylobacter-like organisms, previously classified as Campylobacter.[5] The Arcobacter genus, in fact, was created as recently as 1992.[6] Although they are similar to this other genus, Arcobacter species can grow at lower temperatures than Campylobacter as well as in the air, which Campylobacter cannot.[5]The name Arcobacter is derived from the Latin ""arcus"" meaning ""bow"" and the Greek ""bacter"" meaning ""rod"", and should be understood to mean ""bow-shaped rod"" or ""curved rod"". This is a reference to the characteristic curved shaped that most Arcobacter cells possess.[7]"ARGASIDAE,"The Argasidae are a family of ticks containing the soft ticks. They lack the hard scutum present in the hard ticks (Ixodidae).[1] The capitulum (mouthparts-bearing structure) is located on the underside of the animal's body and is not readily visible.[1] The family contains 193 species, although the composition of the genera is less certain, and more study is needed before the genera can become stable.[2] The currently accepted genera are Antricola, Argas, Nothaspis, Ornithodoros, and Otobius.[2]"ARTHROBACTER,"Arthrobacter (from the Greek, ""jointed small stick"") is a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in soil. All species in this genus are Gram-positive obligate aerobes that are rods during exponential growth and cocci in their stationary phase.Colonies of Arthrobacter have a greenish metallic center on mineral salts pyridone broth incubated at 20 degree C (68 degree F). This genus is distinctive because of its unusual habit of ""snapping division"" in which the outer bacterial cell wall ruptures at a joint (hence its name). Microbiologists refer to the type of cell division in which rods break into cocci as reversion. Under the microscope, these dividing cells appear as chevrons (""V"" shapes). Other notable characteristics are that it can use pyridone as its sole carbon source, and that its cocci are resistant to desiccation and starvation.One species, A. crystallopoietes, has been shown to reduce hexavalent chromium levels in contaminated soil, suggesting that it may be useful in bioremediation.[1]Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus sp. nov., a species capable of degrading high concentrations of 4-chlorophenol, may also be useful in bioremediation.[2] Arthrobacter sp. strain R1 (American Type Culture Collection strain number 49987) has been shown to grow on a variety of aromatic compounds, including homocyclic compounds, such as hydroxybenzoates, as well as N-heterocycles, including pyridine and picoline.[3]Arthrobacter sp H65-7 produces the enzyme inulase II that converts inulin into difructose anhydride (DFA). DFA is a promising nutrient for fighting osteoporis, because it helps absorption of calcium in the intestines.[citation needed]The enzyme Alu obtained from Arthrobacter luteus is able to cleave Alu sequences in human DNA, causing the kind of gene sequence to be named after the enzyme. Alu are a group of moderately repetitive gene sequences (300bp in length). Alu sequences make up 6-8% of the human genome.[4]"ASCARIS,"Ascaris is a genus of parasitic nematode worms known as the ""small intestinal roundworms"", which is a type of helminth. One species, Ascaris lumbricoides, affects humans and causes the disease ascariasis. Another species, Ascaris suum, typically infects pigs. Parascaris equorum, the equine roundworm, is also commonly called an ""Ascarid.""[1]Their eggs are deposited in feces and soil. Plants with the eggs on them infect any organism that consumes them.[2] A. lumbricoides is the largest intestinal roundworm and is the most common helminth infection of humans worldwide. Infestation can cause morbidity by compromising nutritional status,[3] affecting cognitive processes,[citation needed] inducing tissue reactions such as granuloma to larval stages, and by causing intestinal obstruction, which can be fatal."ASPERGILLUS,"Aspergillus is a genus consisting of a few hundred mold species found in various climates worldwide.Aspergillus was first catalogued in 1729 by the Italian priest and biologist Pier Antonio Micheli. Viewing the fungi under a microscope, Micheli was reminded of the shape of an aspergillum (holy water sprinkler), from Latin spargere (to sprinkle), and named the genus accordingly.[1] Today, aspergillum is also the name of an asexual spore-forming structure common to all Aspergillus species; around one-third of species are also known to have a sexual stage."ASTROVIRUS,"Astrovirus is a type of virus that was first discovered in 1975 using electron microscopes following an outbreak of diarrhoea in humans.[1] In addition to humans, astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species (and are classified as genus Mammoastrovirus) and from avian species such as ducks, chickens, and turkey poults (classified as genus Aviastrovirus). Astroviruses are 28-35 nm diameter, icosahedral viruses that have a characteristic five- or sixpointed star-like surface structure when viewed by electron microscopy. Along with the Picornaviridae and the Caliciviridae, the Astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus-sense, single-stranded RNA.[2] Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid.[3] Human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies to be an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide.[2]"ATOPOBIUM,"Atopobium is a genus of Actinobacteria, in the family Coriobacteriaceae.Atopobium species are anaerobic bacteria, Gram-positive rod-shaped or elliptical found as single elements or in pairs or short chains.The atopobium vaginae was discovered in 1999 by Rodriguez [1] as a common commensal of the woman's vagina.This is an facultative anaerobic bacteria, Gram-positive rod-shaped or elliptical cocobacilli, which form small colonies on blood agar at 37 degree C is also positive for acid phosphatase. It can be identified by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing,[2] and is associated with bacterial vaginosis.[3][4]"AURANTIMONAS,Aurantimonas is a genus of bacteria from the family of Aurantimonadaceae.[1][3]AUREOBASIDIUM,"Aureobasidium pullulans is a ubiquitous black, yeast-like fungus that can be found in different environments (e.g. soil, water, air and limestone). It is well known as a naturally occurring epiphyte or endophyte of a wide range of plant species (e.g. apple, grape, cucumber, green beans, cabbage) without causing any symptoms of disease.[1] A. pullulans has a high importance in biotechnology for the production of different enzymes, siderophores and pullulan.[2] Furthermore, A. pullulans is used in biological control of plant diseases, especially storage diseases.[3][4]Chronic human exposure to A. pullulans via humidifiers or air conditioners can lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis) or ""humidifier lung"". This condition is characterized acutely by dyspnea, cough, fever, chest infiltrates, and acute inflammatory reaction. The condition can also be chronic, and lymphocyte-mediated. The chronic condition is characterized radiographically by reticulonodular infiltrates in the lung, with apical sparing. The strains causing infections in humans were reclassified to A. melanogenum.[5]A. pullulans can be cultivated on potato dextrose agar, where it produces smooth, faint pink, yeast-like colonies covered with a slimy mass of spores. Older colonies change to black due to chlamydospore production. Primary conidia are hyaline, smooth, ellipsoidal, one-celled, and variable in shape and size; secondary conidia are smaller. Conidiophores are undifferentiated, intercalary or terminal, or arising as short lateral branches. Endoconidia are produced in an intercalary cell and released into a neighboring empty cell. Hyphae are hyaline, smooth, and thinwalled, with transverse septa. The fungus grows at 10-35 degree C with optimum growth at 30 degree C.A. pullulans is notable for its phenotypic plasticity. Colony morphology may be affected by carbon source, colony age, temperature, light and substrate, with colonies ranging from homogeneous to sectored, yeast-like to filamentous growth, and from small to large.[6] These changes, potentially influenced by epigenetic factors, and the particular developmental sequences that the colonies proceed through may be observed with the naked eye.[6] Besides these morphological plasticity A. pullulans is also adaptable to various stressful conditions: hypersaline, acidic and alkaline, cold, and oligotrophic. Therefore, it is considered to be polyextremotolerant.[7]The morphology-based taxonomy of the species is complicated by the large morphological variability between strains and even within a single strain. Based on molecular analyses, four varieties of the species A. pullulans were recognised: var. pullulans from substrates with low water activity and the phyllosphere; var. melanogenum from aquatic habitats; var. subglaciale from glacial habitats; and var. namibiae, which was described on the basis of only one strain isolated from dolomitic marble in Namibia.[8] However, when the genome sequences of these varieties became available, the differences between them were considered as too large to be accommodated in a single species. Therefore, the varieties were reclassified as new species: A. pullulans, A. melanogenum, A. subglaciale, and A. namibiae.[5]Due to the relatively recent redefinition of the species, most published work does not yet distinguish between the new species belonging to the previously recognised A. pullulans species complex. It is therefore not clear to what extent this knowledge is valid for A. pullulans s. str. and what should be attributed to the three new species."AVIAN ANTIGEN,"Avian influenza ã known informally as avian flu or bird flu ã refers to ""influenza caused by viruses adapted to birds.""[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] The type with the greatest risk is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).""Bird flu"" is a phrase similar to ""swine flu,"" ""dog flu,"" ""horse flu,"" or ""human flu"" in that it refers to an illness caused by any of many different strains of influenza viruses that have adapted to a specific host. All known viruses that cause influenza in birds belong to the species influenza A virus. All subtypes (but not all strains of all subtypes) of influenza A virus are adapted to birds, which is why for many purposes avian flu virus is the influenza A virus. (Note, however, that the ""A"" does not stand for ""avian"").Adaptation is not exclusive. Being adapted toward a particular species does not preclude adaptations, or partial adaptations, toward infecting different species. In this way, strains of influenza viruses are adapted to multiple species, though may be preferential toward a particular host. For example, viruses responsible for influenza pandemics are adapted to both humans and birds. Recent influenza research into the genes of the Spanish flu virus shows it to have genes adapted to both birds and humans, with more of its genes from birds than less deadly later pandemic strains.While its most highly pathogenic strain (H5N1) had been spreading throughout Asia since 2003, avian influenza reached Europe in 2005, and the Middle East, as well as Africa, the following year.[8] On January 22, 2012, China reported its second human death due to bird flu in a month following other fatalities in Vietnam and Cambodia.[9] Companion birds in captivity and parrots are highly unlikely to contract the virus, and there has been no report of a companion bird with avian influenza since 2003. Pigeons do not contract or spread the virus.[10][11][12] 84% of affected bird populations are composed of chicken and farm birds, while the 15% is made up of wild birds according to capture-and-release operations in the 2000s, during the SARs pandemic. The first deadly Canadian case was confirmed on January 3, 2014.[13] On December 2, 2014, two turkey farms in British Columbia, Canada, had been placed under quarantine after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed an avian flu outbreak.[14]"AZOSPIRILLUM,No entryBABESIA,"Babesia (also called Nuttallia)[3] is a genus of protozoan apicomplexan piroplasms which was discovered by the Romanian bacteriologist Victor Babes, that infect the blood and cause a parasitic, hemolytic disease known as babesiosis. Over 100 species of Babesia have been identified, but only a few have been documented to be pathogenic in humans.[4]In the United States, B. microti is the most common strain associated with humans. Other species infect cattle, livestock, and occasionally domestic animals.[5][6] People who contract babesiosis suffer from malaria-like symptoms. As a result, malaria is a common misdiagnosis for the disease."BACILLUS,"Bacillus is a genus of Gram-positive, rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria and a member of the phylum Firmicutes. Bacillus species can be obligate aerobes (oxygen reliant), or facultative anaerobes (having the ability to be aerobic or anaerobic). They will test positive for the enzyme catalase when there has been oxygen used or present.[2] Ubiquitous in nature, Bacillus includes both free-living (nonparasitic) and parasitic pathogenic species. Under stressful environmental conditions, the bacteria can produce oval endospores that are not true 'spores', but to which the bacteria can reduce themselves and remain in a dormant state for very long periods. These characteristics originally defined the genus, but not all such species are closely related, and many have been moved to other genera of the Firmicutes.[3]Many species of Bacillus can produce copious amounts of enzymes which are made use of in different industries. Some species can form intracellular inclusions of polyhydroxyalkanoates under certain adverse environmental conditions, as in a lack of elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources.B.subtilis has proved a valuable model for research. Other species of Bacillus are important pathogens, causing anthrax and food poisoning."BACTEROIDES,"Bacteroides is a genus of Gram-negative, obligate anaerobic bacteria. Bacteroides species are non-endospore-forming bacilli, and may be either motile or non-motile, depending on the species.[1] The DNA base composition is 40-48% GC. Unusual in bacterial organisms, Bacteroides membranes contain sphingolipids. They also contain meso-diaminopimelic acid in their peptidoglycan layer.Bacteroides are normally mutualistic, making up the most substantial portion of the mammalian gastrointestinal flora,[2] where they play a fundamental role in processing of complex molecules to simpler ones in the host intestine.[3][4][5] As many as 1010-1011 cells per gram of human feces have been reported.[6] They can use simple sugars when available; however, the main sources of energy for Bacteroides species in the gut are complex host-derived and plant glycans.[7] Studies indicate that long-term diet is strongly associated with the gut microbiome composition - those who eat plenty of protein and animal fats have predominantly Bacteroides bacteria, while for those who consume more carbohydrates the Prevotella species dominate.[8]One of the most important clinically is Bacteroides fragilis.Bacteroides melaninogenicus has recently been reclassified and split into Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella intermedia.[9]"BALANTIDIUM,Balantidium coli is a parasitic species of ciliate protozoan that causes the disease Balantidiasis.[1][2] It is the only member of the ciliate phylum known to be pathogenic to humans.[1][2]BARTONELLA,"Bartonella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. It is the only genus in the family Bartonellaceae.[2][3] Facultative intracellular parasites, Bartonella species can infect healthy people, but are considered especially important as opportunistic pathogens.[4] Bartonella species are transmitted by vectors such as ticks, fleas, sand flies, and mosquitoes. At least eight Bartonella species or subspecies are known to infect humans.[5]Bartonella henselae is the organism responsible for cat scratch disease, a self-limited disease except in immunocompromised hosts."BERGEYELLA,No entryBIFIDOBACTERIUM,"Bifidobacterium is a genus of Gram-positive, nonmotile, often branched anaerobic bacteria. They are ubiquitous inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract, vagina[1][2] and mouth (B. dentium) of mammals, including humans. Bifidobacteria are one of the major genera of bacteria that make up the colon flora in mammals. Some bifidobacteria are used as probiotics.Before the 1960s, Bifidobacterium species were collectively referred to as ""Lactobacillus bifidus""."BILOPHILA,No entryBIPOLARIS,Bipolaris is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Pleosporaceae. It was circumscribed by mycologist Robert A. Shoemaker in 1959.[1]BLASTOCYSTIS,"Blastocystis is a genus of single-celled protozoan parasites belonging to a group of organisms known as the Stramenopiles (also called Heterokonts) that includes algae, diatoms, and water molds. Blastocystis comprises several species, living in the gastrointestinal tracts of species as diverse as humans, farm animals, birds, rodents, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and cockroaches.[1]Blastocystis exhibits low host specificity, and many different species of Blastocystis can infect humans[2] and by current convention, any of these species would be identified as Blastocystis hominis if they were identified in a human. These have a widespread geographic distribution and are found at a rate of 5-10% in most developed countries, and a rate of up to 50% in less developed areas.[3] High rates of infection are also found in individuals in developed countries who work with animals.[4] Although the role of Blastocystis hominis in human disease is often referred to as controversial, a systematic survey of research studies conducted by 11 infectious disease specialists from nine countries, found that over 95% of papers published in the last 10 years identified it as causing illness in immunocompetent individuals. The paper attributed confusion over pathogenicity to the existence of asymptomatic carriers, a phenomenon the study noted is common to all gastrointestinal protozoa.[3]"BLASTOMYCES,"Blastomyces dermatitidis is the causal agent of blastomycosis, an invasive and often serious fungal infection found occasionally in humans and other animals in regions where the fungus is endemic.[1] The causal organism is a fungus living in soil and wet, decaying wood, often in an area close to a waterway such as a lake, river or stream.[1] Indoor growth may also occur, for example, in accumulated debris in damp sheds or shacks. The fungus is endemic to parts of eastern North America, particularly boreal northern Ontario, southeastern Manitoba, Quebec south of the St. Lawrence River, parts of the U.S. Appalachian mountains and interconnected eastern mountain chains, the west bank of Lake Michigan, the state of Wisconsin, and the entire Mississippi Valley including the valleys of some major tributaries such as the Ohio River. In addition, it occurs rarely in Africa both north and south of the Sahara Desert, as well as in the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent. Though it has never been directly observed growing in nature, it is thought to grow there as a cottony white mold, similar to the growth seen in artificial culture at 25 degree C (77 degree F). In an infected human or animal, however, it converts in growth form and becomes a large-celled budding yeast.[1] Blastomycosis is generally readily treatable with systemic antifungal drugs once it is correctly diagnosed; however, delayed diagnosis is very common except in highly endemic areas."BLASTOSCHIZOMYCES,No entryBOCAVIRUS,"Bocaparvovirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Parvoviridae, in the subfamily Parvovirinae. Human, cattle, and dog serve as natural hosts. There are currently 12 species in this genus including the type species Ungulate bocaparvovirus 1. Diseases associated with this genus include: human: acute respiratory illness; cattle: diarrhea and mild respiratory symptoms.[1][2]"BORDETELLA,"Bordetella is a genus of small (0.2 - 0.7 micrometres), Gram-negative coccobacilli of the phylum Proteobacteria. Bordetella species, with the exception of B. petrii, are obligate aerobes, as well as highly fastidious, or difficult to culture. Three species are human pathogens (B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. bronchiseptica); one of these (B. bronchiseptica) is also motile.[1]B. pertussis and occasionally B. parapertussis cause pertussis or whooping cough in humans, and some B. parapertussis strains can colonise sheep. B. bronchiseptica rarely infects healthy humans, though disease in immunocompromised patients has been reported.[2] B. bronchiseptica causes several diseases in other mammals, including kennel cough and atrophic rhinitis in dogs and pigs, respectively. Other members of the genus cause similar diseases in other mammals, and in birds (B. hinzii, B. avium).The Bordetella genus is named after Jules Bordet."BORRELIA,"Borrelia is a genus of bacteria of the spirochete phylum.[1] It causes borreliosis, a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by ticks and some by lice, depending on the species.[2] The 36 known species of Borrelia are named after the French biologist Amedee Borrel."BOTRYTIS,"Botrytis is a genus of anamorphic fungi in the family Sclerotiniaceae. Botrytis (also known as grey mold) belongs to the group hyphomycetes and has about 30 different species. It is a plant parasite as well as saprophytes on both agricultural and forest trees. It produces stout, dark, branching conidiophores that bear clusters of paler conidia (grey in mass) on denticles from apical ampullae. It is a common outdoor fungus and can be detected in spore trap samples. The fungus is often found growing on indoor plants. Although no mycotoxin has been reported from this fungus, it may cause hay fever, asthma and keratomycosis. [2]"BRANHAMELLA,The only species of Branhamella (Branhamella catarrhalis) is reclassified to Moraxella catarrhalis[2]BREVIBACILLUS,Brevibacillus is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria in the family Paenibacillaceae.BREVIBACTERIUM,"Brevibacterium is a genus of bacteria of the order Actinomycetales. They are Gram-positive soil organisms. It is the sole genus in the family Brevibacteriaceae.Note: Brevibacterium stationis may now be re-classified as Corynebacterium stationis.[1]Brevibacterium linens is ubiquitously present on the human skin, where it causes foot odor. The familiar odor is due to sulphur containing compounds known as S-methyl thioesters. The same bacterium is also employed to ferment several cheeses such as Munster, Limburger, Port-du-Salut, Raclette and Nasal. Its aroma also attracts mosquitoes.[2]The first comprehensive proteomic reference map of B. linens was recently published[3]"BREVUNDIMONAS,The Brevundimonas are a genus of proteobacteria.BRUCELLA,"Brucella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria,[2][3] named after David Bruce (1855-1931). They are small (0.5 to 0.7 by 0.6 to 1.5 micrometresm), non-encapsulated, flagellated,[4] facultatively intracellular coccobacilli.Brucella is the cause of brucellosis, which is a zoonosis. It is transmitted by ingesting contaminated food (such as unpasteurized milk products), direct contact with an infected animal, or inhalation of aerosols. Transmission from human to human, for example through sexual intercourse or from mother to child, is exceedingly rare, but possible.[5] Minimum infectious exposure is between 10 - 100 organisms.The different species of Brucella are genetically very similar, although each has a slightly different host specificity (see below). Hence, the NCBI taxonomy includes most Brucella species under Brucella melitensis.The many names of brucellosis include (human disease/animal disease):Malta fever/Bangês diseaseUndulant fever/enzootic abortionMediterranean fever/epizootic abortionRock fever of Gibraltar/slinking of calvesGastric fever/ram epididymitisContagious abortion/spontaneous abortion[6]"BUNYAVIRIDAE,"Bunyaviridae is a family of negative-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses. Though generally found in arthropods or rodents, certain viruses in this family occasionally infect humans. Some of them also infect plants.[1]Bunyaviridae are vector-borne viruses. With the exception of Hantaviruses, transmission occurs via an arthropod vector (mosquitos, tick, or sandfly). Hantaviruses are transmitted through contact with deer mice feces. Incidence of infection is closely linked to vector activity, for example, mosquito-borne viruses are more common in the summer.[1]Human infections with certain Bunyaviridae, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, are associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality, consequently handling of these viruses must occur with a Biosafety level 4 laboratory. They are also the cause of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome.[2]Hanta virus or Hantavirus Hemorrhagic fever, common in Korea, Scandinavia, Russia, and western North America, is associated with high fever, lung edema and pulmonary failure. Mortality is around 55%.The antibody reaction plays an important role in decreasing levels of viremia."BURKHOLDERIA,"Burkholderia is a genus of Proteobacteria whose pathogenic members include Burkholderia mallei, responsible for glanders, a disease that occurs mostly in horses and related animals; Burkholderia pseudomallei, causative agent of melioidosis; and Burkholderia cepacia, an important pathogen of pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).The Burkholderia (previously part of Pseudomonas) genus name refers to a group of virtually ubiquitous Gram-negative, motile, obligately aerobic rod-shaped bacteria including both animal and plant pathogens, as well as some environmentally important species. In particular, B. xenovorans (previously named Pseudomonas cepacia then B. cepacia and B. fungorum) is renowned for being catalase positive (affecting patients with chronic granulomatous disease) and its ability to degrade chlororganic pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).The use of Burkholderia species for agricultural purposes (such as biodegradation, biocontrol, and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria) is subject to discussions because of possible pathogenic effects in immunocompromised people (especially cystic fibrosis-sufferers), e.g., hospital-acquired infections. However, the animal pathogenic and the plant/soil species belong to different groups, and it was proposed to separate them into two different genera, to avoid misinterpretations. [1]Due to their antibiotic resistance and the high mortality rate from their associated diseases, B. mallei and B. pseudomallei are considered to be potential biological warfare agents, targeting livestock and humans.The genus was named after Walter H. Burkholder, plant pathologist at Cornell University."BUTTIAUXELLA,No entryBUTYRIBACTERIUM,No entryCALICIVIRUS,"Caliciviridae is a family of viruses, members of Class IV of the Baltimore scheme. They are positive-sense, single stranded RNA which is non-segmented. There are currently seven species in this family, divided among 5 genera. Diseases associated with this family include: feline calicivirus: respiratory disease; rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus: often-fatal hemorrhages; norwalk group of viruses: gastroenteritis.[1][2] Caliciviruses naturally infect vertebrates, and have been found in a number of organisms such as humans, cattle, pigs, cats, chickens, reptiles, dolphins and amphibians. The caliciviruses have a simple construction and are not enveloped. The capsid appears hexagonal/spherical and has icosahedral symmetry (T=1 or T=3[1]) with a diameter of 35-39 nm.[3]Caliciviruses are not very well studied because until recently they could not be grown in culture, and there is no suitable animal model. However, the recent application of modern genomic technologies has led to an increased understanding of the virus family.[3] A recent isolate from rhesus monkeys-Tulane virus-can be grown in culture and this system promises to increase our understanding of these viruses.[4]The name calicivirus is derived from the Greek word calyx meaning cup or goblet. This name is appropriate as many strains have visible cup-shaped depressions."CALYMMATOBACTERIUM,No entryCAMPYLOBACTER,"Campylobacter (meaning ""curved bacteria"") is a genus of Gram-negative, microaerophilic, oxidase-positive, nonfermentative bacteria.[1] Campylobacter species are typically spiral-shaped and able to move via unipolar or bipolar flagella.[1] Most Campylobacter species are pathogenic and can infect humans and other animals. At least a dozen species of Campylobacter have been implicated in human disease, with C. jejuni and C. coli the most common.[2] C. jejuni is now recognized as one of the main causes of bacterial foodborne disease in many developed countries.[2][3] C. fetus is a cause of spontaneous abortions in cattle and sheep, as well as an opportunistic pathogen in humans.[4]"CANDIDA,"Candida is a genus of yeasts and is the most common cause of fungal infections worldwide.[1] Many species are harmless commensals or endosymbionts of hosts including humans; however, when mucosal barriers are disrupted or the immune system is compromised they can invade and cause disease.[2] Candida albicans is the most commonly isolated species, and can cause infections (candidiasis or thrush) in humans and other animals. In winemaking, some species of Candida can potentially spoil wines.[3]Many species are found in gut flora, including C. albicans in mammalian hosts, whereas others live as endosymbionts in insect hosts.[4][5][6]Systemic infections of the bloodstream and major organs (candidemia or invasive candidiasis), particularly in immunocompromised patients, affect over 90,000 people a year in the U.S.[7]The DNA of several Candida species has been sequenced.[7]Antibiotics promote yeast infections, including gastrointestinal Candida overgrowth, and penetration of the GI mucosa.[8] While women are more susceptible to genital yeast infections, men can also be infected. Certain factors, such as prolonged antibiotic use, increase the risk for both men and women. People with diabetes or impaired immune systems, such as those with HIV, are more susceptible to yeast infections.[9][10]Candida antarctica is a source of industrially important lipases."CAPILLARIA,"Hungarian author Frigyes Karinthy's fantastic novel Capillaria (Hungarian: Capillˆria, 1921), which depicts an undersea world inhabited exclusively by women, recounts, in a satirical vein reminiscent of the style of Jonathan Swift (author of Gulliver's Travels), the first time that men and women experience sex with one another.Expressing a pessimistic, perhaps misogynistic, view of women, the novel suggests that, with disastrous effect, women, who are emotional and illogical, dominate men, the creative, rational force within humanity, who represent the builders of civilization.The males, known as bullpops, are of small stature. They spend their time building and rebuilding tall, complex, rather phallic, towers that the gigantic women destroy as quickly as these structures are erected. Meanwhile, the females engage in sexual adventures, surviving by eating the brains of the miniature men, who have become little more than personified male genitals.The undersea kingdom is mentioned in the comic book version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.[full citation needed]A readily available summary of the relatively rare novel's plot is provided in The Dictionary of Imaginary Places.[1]"CAPNOCYTOPHAGA,"Capnocytophaga is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. Normally found in the oropharyngeal tract of mammals, they are involved in the pathogenesis of some animal bite wounds as well as periodontal diseases.[1]Capnocytophaga canimorsus transmission following a dog bite can cause overwhelming sepsis in asplenic patients, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Empiric treatment for this bacteria following a dog bite, consisting of a third-generation cephalosporin early in the infection, should be instituted in these patient populations, or following deep bites or dog bites to the hand."CARDIOBACTERIUM,"Cardiobacterium hominis is a Gram-negative rod commonly grouped with other bacteria into the HACEK group. It is one of several bacteria normally present in the mouth and upper part of the respiratory tract such as nose and throat. However, it may also rarely cause endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves.[1]"CAT SCRATCH FEVER,"Cat-scratch disease (CSD), also known as cat-scratch fever,[1] Teeny's disease,[1] inoculation lymphoreticulosis,[1] and subacute regional lymphadenitis,[1] is a common and usually benign infectious disease caused by a bacterium, either Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana.[2][3] It is most commonly found in children following a scratch or bite from a cat[2] within about one to two weeks."CEDECEA,"Cedecea is a genus of extremely rare bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae.[1] The name of this genus was derived from CDC, the abbreviation for the Centers for Disease Control where the initial members of this genus were discovered.[2] This genus resembles no other group of Enterobacteriaceae.[3] Cedecea bacteria are Gram-negative, bacillus in shape, motile, nonencapsulated, and nonspore-forming.[4][5] The strains of Cedecea appear to be similar to those of Serratia. Both Cedecea and Serratia are lipase positive and resistant to colistin and cephalothin; however, Cedecea is unable to hydrolyze gelatin or DNA.[5][6][7][8]"CELLULOMONAS,"Cellulomonas is a genus of Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria. One of their main distinguishing features is their ability to degrade cellulose, using enzymes such as endoglucanase and exoglucanase.[1] They are members of the actinobacteria.[2]"CHAETOMIUM,"Chaetomium is a genus of fungi in the Chaetomiaceae family. It is a dematiaceous (dark-walled) mold normally found in soil, air, cellulose and plant debris. According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), there are about 95 species in the widespread genus.[1]Members of this genus typically have superficial, ostiolar perithecia, covered in hairs. Asci are often clavate and evanescent, bearing eight spores. Ascospores are usually lemon-shaped, commonly colored olive-brown. Mycelia often grows in conglomerate masses that resemble rope.[2]As well as being a contaminant, Chaetomium spp. are also encountered as causative agents of infections in humans. Many cases cause type 1 allergic reactions and infections. A few cases of fatal deep infections due to Chaetomium atrobrunneum have been reported in the immunocompromised host. Other clinical syndromes include brain abscess, peritonitis, and onychomycosis.Some Chaetomium infections in humans can be avoided with proper hygiene habits. For instance, the Sohnian Kittah strain's presence can often be eliminated entirely with household products."CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS,"Chikungunya [1](Makonde for ""that which bends up"") is an infection caused by the chikungunya virus. The disease features the sudden onset of fever two to four days after exposure. The fever usually lasts two to seven days, while accompanying joint pains typically last weeks or months but sometimes years.[2][3][4] The mortality rate is a little less than 1 in 1000, with the elderly or those with underlying chronic medical problems most likely having severe complications.[5]The virus is passed to humans by two species of mosquito of the genus Aedes: A. albopictus and A. aegypti.[6][7] Animal reservoirs of the virus include monkeys, birds, cattle, and rodents.[8] This is in contrast to dengue, for which primates are the only hosts.[9] Since 2004, the disease has occurred in outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Americas.The best means of prevention is overall mosquito control and the avoidance of bites by mosquitoes in areas where the disease is common.[10] This may be partly achieved with the use of mosquito nets. No specific treatment is known, but supportive care is recommended, including rest, fluids, and medications to reduce fever and joint pain.[11]"CHILOMASTIX,No entryCHLAMYDIA,"Chlamydia is a genus of bacteria that are obligate intracellular parasites. Chlamydia infections are the most common bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in humans and are the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide.[1]The three Chlamydia species include Chlamydia trachomatis (a human pathogen), Chlamydia suis (affects only swine) and Chlamydia muridarum (affects only mice and hamsters).[2] Additionally, three species that were previously classified as Chlamydia have since 1999 been reclassified into the then newly-created Chlamydophila genus: Chlamydophila psittaci, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pecorum."CHROMOBACTERIUM,"Chromobacterium is a genus of gram-negative rods.[1]:279 There are at least two known species within the genus, Chromobacterium violaceum and Chromobacterium subtsugae[2] the latter was discovered by Agricultural Research Scientists (ARS) in Beltsville, Maryland.[2]"CHRYSEOBACTERIUM,"Chryseobacterium is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. Three novel cold-tolerant species of Chryseobacterium, C. oranimense, C. haifense, and C. bovis, have been detected in raw milk in Israel."CHRYSEOMONAS,"Pseudomonas luteola is an opportunistic pathogen, found ubiquitously in damp environments. Originally designated in the Chryseomonas genus, the species has since been reassigned to the Pseudomonas genus."CHRYSOSPORIUM,"Chrysosporium is a type of hyaline hyphomycetes fungi in the family Onygenaceae.Chrysosporium colonies are moderately fast-growing, flat, white to tan to beige in color; they often have a powdery or granular surface texture. Hyaline, one-celled (ameroconidia) are produced directly on vegetative hyphae by non-specialized conidiogenous cells. Conidia are typically pyriform to clavate with truncate bases (6 - 7 by 3.5 - 4 micrometres) and are formed either intercalary (arthroconidia), laterally (often on pedicels), or terminally."CIGUATERA FISH POISONING,"Ciguatera is a foodborne illness caused by eating certain reef fish whose flesh is contaminated with a toxin made by dinoflagellates such as Gambierdiscus toxicus which live in tropical and subtropical waters. These dinoflagellates adhere to coral, algae and seaweed, where they are eaten by herbivorous fish which in turn are eaten by larger carnivorous fish. This is called biomagnification.Gambierdiscus toxicus is the primary dinoflagellate responsible for the production of a number of similar polyether toxins, including ciguatoxin, maitotoxin, gambieric acid and scaritoxin, as well as the long-chain alcohol palytoxin.[1][2] Other dinoflagellates that may cause ciguatera include Prorocentrum spp., Ostreopsis spp., Coolia monotis, Thecadinium spp. and Amphidinium carterae.[3] Predator species near the top of the food chain in tropical and subtropical waters are most likely to cause ciguatera poisoning, although many other species cause occasional outbreaks of toxicity.[4]Ciguatoxin is odourless, tasteless and cannot be removed by conventional cooking.[5][6]Researchers suggest that ciguatera outbreaks caused by warm climatic conditions propelled the migratory voyages of Polynesians between 1000 and 1400.[7][8]"CITROBACTER,"Citrobacter is a genus of Gram-negative coliform bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae family.The species C. amalonaticus, C. koseri, and C. freundii can use citrate as a sole carbon source. Citrobacter species are differentiated by their ability to convert tryptophan to indole, ferment lactose, and use malonate.[1]Citrobacter shows the ability to accumulate uranium by building phosphate complexes.[2]"CLADOPHIALOPHORA,No entryCLADOSPORIUM,"Cladosporium is a genus of fungi including some of the most common indoor and outdoor molds. Species produce olive-green to brown or black colonies, and have dark-pigmented conidia that are formed in simple or branching chains.The many species of Cladosporium are commonly found on living and dead plant material. Some species are plant pathogens, others parasitize other fungi. Cladosporium spores are wind-dispersed and they are often extremely abundant in outdoor air. Indoors Cladosporium species may grow on surfaces when moisture is present.Cladosporium fulvum, cause of tomato leaf mould, has been an important genetic model, in that the genetics of host resistance are understood.[2]"CLONORCHIS,"Clonorchis sinensis, the Chinese liver fluke, is a human liver fluke in the class Trematoda, phylum Platyhelminthes. This parasite lives in the liver of humans, and is found mainly in the common bile duct and gall bladder, feeding on bile. These animals, which are believed to be the third most prevalent worm parasite in the world, are endemic to Japan, China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, currently infecting an estimated 30,000,000 humans.[1] 85% of cases are found in China.It is the most prevalent human trematode in Asia, and still actively transmitted in Korea, China, Vietnam and also Russia, with 200 million people at constant risk. Recent studies have proved that it is capable of causing cancer of liver and bile duct, and in fact the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classed it as a group 1 biological carcinogen in 2009.[2][3][4]"CLOSTRIDIUM,"Clostridium is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes. They are obligate anaerobes capable of producing endospores.[1][2] Individual cells are rod-shaped, which gives them their name, from the Greek kloster or spindle. These characteristics traditionally defined the genus; but many species originally classified as Clostridium have been reclassified in other genera."COCCIDIOIDES,"Coccidioides is a genus of dimorphic ascomycetes in the family Onygenaceae. Member species are the cause of coccidioidomycosis, also known as San Joaquin Valley fever, an infectious fungal disease largely confined to the Western Hemisphere and endemic in the Southwestern United States.[2] The host acquires the disease by respiratory inhalation of spores disseminated in their natural habitat. The causative agents of coccidioidomycosis are Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii. Both C. immitas and C. posadasii are indistinguishable during laboratory testing and commonly referred in literature as Coccidioides.[3]"COLIFORM,"Coliform bacteria are a commonly used bacterial indicator of sanitary quality of foods and water. They are defined as rod-shaped Gram-negative non-spore forming and motile or non-motile bacteria which can ferment lactose with the production of acid and gas when incubated at 35-37 degrees C.[1] Coliforms can be found in the aquatic environment, in soil and on vegetation; they are universally present in large numbers in the feces of warm-blooded animals. While coliforms themselves are not normally causes of serious illness, they are easy to culture, and their presence is used to indicate that other pathogenic organisms of fecal origin may be present. Such pathogens include disease-causing bacteria, viruses, or protozoa and many multicellular parasites. Coliform procedures are performed in aerobic or reduced oxygen conditions.Typical genera include:[2]Citrobacter,EnterobacterHafniaKlebsiellaFecal coliform:EscherichiaEscherichia coli (E. coli), a rod-shaped member of the coliform group, can be distinguished from most other coliforms by its ability to ferment lactose at 44 degrees C in the fecal coliform test, and by its growth and color reaction on certain types of culture media. When cultured on an eosin methylene blue (EMB) plate, a positive result for E. coli is metallic green colonies on a dark purple media. Escherichia coli have an incubation period of 12-72 hours with the optimal growth temperature being 30-37 degrees C. Unlike the general coliform group, E. coli are almost exclusively of fecal origin and their presence is thus an effective confirmation of fecal contamination. Most strains of E. coli are harmless, but some can cause serious illness in humans. Infection symptoms and signs include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting and occasionally, fever. The bacteria can also cause pneumonia, other respiratory illnesses and urinary tract infections.[3][4]An easy way to differentiate between different types of coliform bacteria is by using an Eosin Methylene Blue Agar plate. This plate is partially inhibitory to Gram (+) bacteria, and will produce a color change in the Gram (-) bacterial colonies based on lactose fermentation abilities. Strong lactose fermenters will appear as dark blue/purple/black, and E.coli (which also ferments lactose) colonies will be dark colored, but will also appear to have a metallic green sheen. Other coliform bacteria will appear as thick, slimy colonies, with non-fermenters being colorless, and weak fermenters being pink."COLLINSELLA,"Collinsella is a genus of Actinobacteria, in the family Coriobacteriaceae."COMAMONAS,"The Comamonas are a genus of Proteobacteria .[1] Like all Proteobacteria, they are Gram-negative bacteria. The Comamonas are aerobic organism and motile by using bipolar or polar tufts of 1-5 agella."CORONAVIRUS,"Coronaviruses are species in the genera of virus belonging to one of two subfamilies Coronavirinae and Torovirinae in the family Coronaviridae, in the order Nidovirales.[1][2] Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome and with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genomic size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, extraordinarily large for an RNA virus.The name ""coronavirus"" is derived from the Latin corona, meaning crown or halo, and refers to the characteristic appearance of virions under electron microscopy (E.M.) with a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of a royal crown or of the solar corona. This morphology is created by the viral spike (S) peplomers, which are proteins that populate the surface of the virus and determine host tropism.Proteins that contribute to the overall structure of all coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In the specific case of the SARS coronavirus (see below), a defined receptor-binding domain on S mediates the attachment of the virus to its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).[3] Some coronaviruses (specifically the members of Betacoronavirus subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).[1]"CORYNEBACTERIUM,"Corynebacterium is a genus of Gram-positive, aerobe, rod-shaped bacteria. They are widely distributed in nature and are mostly innocuous.[1] Some are useful in industrial settings such as C. glutamicum.[2] Others can cause human disease, including most notably diphtheria which is caused by C. diphtheriae."COWPOX,"Cowpox is an infectious disease caused by the cowpox virus. The virus, part of the orthopoxvirus family, is closely related to the vaccinia virus. The virus is zoonotic, meaning that it is transferable between species, such as from animal to human. The transferral of the disease was first observed in dairymaids who touched the udders of infected cows and consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands.[1] Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents. Cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease.[1] Its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox inspired the first smallpox vaccine, created and administered by English physician Edward Jenner.[2]The word –vaccination,” coined by Jenner in 1796,[2] is derived from the Latin root vaccinus, meaning of or from the cow.[3] Once vaccinated, a patient develops antibodies that make him/her immune to cowpox, but they also develop immunity to the smallpox virus, or Variola virus. The cowpox vaccinations and later incarnations proved so successful that in 1980, the World Health Organization announced that smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by vaccination efforts worldwide.[3] Other orthopox viruses remain prevalent in certain communities and continue to infect humans, such as the cowpox virus (CPXV) in Europe, vaccinia in Brazil, and monkeypox virus in Central and West Africa."COXIELLA,"Coxiella refers to a genus of Gram-negative bacteria in the family Coxiellaceae. It is named after Harold Herald Rea Cox (1907-1986), an American bacteriologist. It is one of the Gammaproteobacteria.[1]Coxiella burnetii is the only member of this genus. It is an intracellular bacterium and it survives within the phagolysosomes of its host. It causes Q fever.Treatment: 1st Generation cephalosporin"CRONOBACTER,"Cronobacter is a genus of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae. They are generally motile, reduce nitrate, use citrate, hydrolyze esculin and arginine, and are positive for L-ornithine decarboxylation. Acid is produced from D-glucose, D-sucrose, D-raffinose, D-melibiose, D-cellobiose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, L-arabinose, D-trehalose, galacturonate and D-maltose. Cronobacter spp. are also generally positive for acetoin production (Voges-Proskauer test) and negative for the methyl red test, indicating 2,3-butanediol rather than mixed acid fermentation. The type species of the genus Cronobacter is Cronobacter sakazakii comb. nov. The genome of one strain of Cronobacter sakazakii (BAA-894) has been sequenced and annotated.[3] According to multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) the genus originated ~40 MYA, and the most clinically significant species, C. sakazakii, was distinguishable ~15-23 MYA. .[4]"CRYPTOCOCCUS,"Cryptococcus (Greek for ""hidden sphere"") is a genus of fungus. These fungi grow in culture as yeasts. The sexual forms or teleomorphs of Cryptococcus species are filamentous fungi in the genus Filobasidiella. The name Cryptococcus is used when referring to the yeast states of the fungi."CRYPTOSPORIDIUM,"Cryptosporidium is a genus of apicomplexan protozoans that can cause gastrointestinal illness with diarrhea in humans. Cryptosporidium is the organism most commonly isolated in HIV-positive patients presenting with diarrhea. Treatment is symptomatic, with fluid rehydration, electrolyte correction and management of any pain. Cryptosporidium oocysts are 4-6 micrometres in diameter and exhibit partial acid-fast staining. They must be differentiated from other partially acid-fast organisms including Cyclospora cayetanensis."CUNNINGAMELLA,"Cunninghamella is a genus of fungi in the order Mucorales, and the family Cunninghamellaceae.[2] The genus was circumscribed by French mycologist Alphonse Louis Paul Matruchot in 1903.[3]"CUPRIAVIDUS,"Cupriavidus is a genus of bacteria that includes the former genus Wautersia.[1] They are characterized as Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped organisms with oxidative metabolism. They possess peritrichous _agella, are obligate aerobic organisms, and are chemoorganotrophic or chemolithotrophic. Resistance to metals (including copper) has been described. These organisms have been found in both soil and in clinical isolates.[2]"CYCLOSPORA,"Cyclospora is a genus of apicomplexan parasites. It includes the species Cyclospora cayetanensis, the causative agent of cyclosporiasis.[1]"DELFTIA,Delftia is a genus of Comamonad bacteria.DERMABACTER,No entryDERMACENTOR,"Dermacentor is a genus of ticks in the family Ixodidae, the hard ticks. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with native species on all continents except Australia. Most occur in the Nearctic ecozone.[2]Hosts of Dermacentor ticks include many large and small mammals, including horses, deer, cattle, lagomorphs, peccaries, porcupines, tapirs, desert bighorn sheep, and humans.[2] The American dog tick (D. variabilis) is a member of the genus.[3]Dermacentor are vectors of many pathogens, including Rickettsia rickettsii, which causes the disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Coxiella burnetii, which causes Q fever, Anaplasma marginale, which causes anaplasmosis in cattle, Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia, Babesia caballi, which causes equine piroplasmosis, and the Flavivirus that causes Powassan encephalitis.[2] Dermacentor ticks inject a neurotoxin that causes tick paralysis.[2]"DESULFOVIBRIO,"Desulfovibrio is a genus of Gram-negative sulfate-reducing bacteria. Desulfovibrio species are commonly found in aquatic environments with high levels of organic material, as well as in water-logged soils, and form major community members of extreme oligotrophic habitats such as deep granitic fractured rock aquifers.Like other sulfate-reducing bacteria, Desulfovibrio was long considered to be obligately anaerobic. This is not strictly correct: while growth may be limited, these bacteria can survive in O2-rich environments. These types of bacteria are known as aerotolerant.Some Desulfovibrio species have in recent years been shown to have bioremediation potential for toxic radionuclides such as uranium by a reductive bioaccumulation process."DF-2 (CDC GROUP),"Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a fastidious, slow-growing Gram-negative rod of the genus Capnocytophaga.[1][2] It is a commensal bacterium in the normal gingival flora of canine and feline species. Transmission may occur through bites, licks,or even close proximity with animals.[3] C. canimorsus generally has low virulence in healthy individuals,[4] but has been observed to cause severe illness in persons with pre-existing conditions.[5] The pathogenesis of C. canimorsus is still largely unknown, but increased clinical diagnoses have fostered an interest in the bacillus. Treatment with antibiotics is effective in most cases, but the most important yet basic diagnostic tool available to clinicians remains the knowledge of recent exposure to canines or felines.[3] Very little is known about the pathogenesis of this zoonotic pathogen."DIALISTER,Dialister is a genus of Firmicutes bacteria classified within the class NegativiDICROCOELIUM,"Liver flukes are parasites. They are a polyphyletic group of trematodes (phylum Platyhelminthes). Adults of liver flukes are localized in the liver of various mammals, including humans. These flatworms can occur in bile ducts, gallbladder, and liver parenchyma. They feed on blood. Adult flukes produce eggs which are passed into the intestine. It depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail and a fish) to complete its life cycle.Examples include:Clonorchis sinensis (the ""Chinese liver fluke"" or the ""Oriental liver fluke"")Dicrocoelium dendriticum (lancet liver fluke)Dicrocoelium hospesFasciola hepatica (the ""sheep liver fluke"")Fascioloides magna (the ""giant liver fluke"")Fasciola giganticaFasciola jacksoniMetorchis conjunctusMetorchis albidusProtofasciola robustaParafasciolopsis fasciomorphaeOpisthorchis viverrini (Southeast Asian liver fluke)Opisthorchis felineus (cat liver fluke).Opisthorchis guayaquilensis"DIENTAMOEBA,"Dientamoeba fragilis is a single-celled parasite found in the gastrointestinal tract of some humans, pigs and gorillas. It causes gastrointestinal upset in some people, but not in others.[1] It is an important cause of travellers diarrhoea, chronic diarrhoea, fatigue and, in children, failure to thrive."DIPHTHEROIDES,No entryDIPHYLLOBOTHRIUM,"Diphyllobothrium is a genus of tapeworm which can cause Diphyllobothriasis in humans through consumption of raw or undercooked fish. The principal species causing diphyllobothriosis is Diphyllobothrium latum, known as the broad or fish tapeworm, or broad fish tapeworm. D. latum is a pseudophyllid cestode that infects fish and mammals. D. latum is native to Scandinavia, western Russia, and the Baltics, though it is now also present in North America, especially the Pacific Northwest. In Far East Russia, D. klebanovskii, having Pacific salmon as its second intermediate host, was identified.[1] Other members of the genus Diphyllobothrium include Diphyllobothrium dendriticum (the salmon tapeworm), which has a much larger range (the whole northern hemisphere), D. pacificum, D. cordatum, D. ursi, D. lanceolatum, D. dalliae, and D. yonagoensis, all of which infect humans only infrequently. In Japan, the most common species in human infection is D. nihonkaiense, which was only identified as a separate species from D. latum in 1986.[2] More recently, a molecular study found D. nihonkaiense and D. klebanovskii to be a single species.[3]"DIPTERA,"True flies are insects of the order Diptera (from the Greek di = two, and ptera = wings). The most obvious distinction from other orders of insects is that a typical fly possesses a pair of flight wings on the mesothorax and a pair of halteres, derived from the hind wings, on the metathorax. (Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless.) The only other order of insects bearing two true, functional wings plus any form of halteres are the Strepsiptera, and in contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax."DIPYLIDIUM,No entryDIROFILARIA,"Dirofilaria is a genus of roundworm (nematodes). These worms cause Dirofilariasis in humans defined as infection by filarial nematodes of the genus Dirofilaria.Two subgenera, Dirofilaria (Dirofilaria) species and Dirofilaria (Nochtiella) species are recognized. Dirofilaria (Dirofilaria) immitis is the most frequent agent of pulmonary dirofilariasis. Although D. (Dirofilaria) immitis primarily causes lung lesions, it has, on rare occasion caused intra-abdominal infection and even subcutaneous nodules. Approximately 20 species of Dirofilaria are in the subgenus Nochtiella; of these, Dirofilaria (Nochtiella) repens, Dirofilaria (Nochtiella) tenuis, and Dirofilaria (Nochtiella) striata have produced human infection, while Dirofilaria (Nochtiella) ursi-like infections that represent either D. (Nochtiella) ursi or Dirofilaria (Nochtiella) subdermata, or both, rarely can cause human infections. Most human infections by members of the subgenus Nochtiella are D. (Nochtiella) tenuis in the western hemisphere and D (Nochtiella) repens in the eastern hemisphere.[1]These worms are natural parasites of other, non-human, mammals. In humans, there are two forms of the disease (a) pulmonary dirofilariasis caused primarily by Dirofilaria immitis (the dog heartworm), and (b) subcutaneous dirofilariasis caused primarily by D. tenuis and D. repens, parasites of the raccoon and of dogs and cats respectively; and by D. ursi from the bear. Humans are poor hosts for all Dirofilaria species such that in humans, the worm usually dies before reaching sexual maturity and does not release viable microfilariae.Dirofilaria immitis is a common parasite of dogs (and some other carnivores) in many parts of the world. It is a considerable veterinary problem, particularly in the USA and Japan. In the dog, adult worms lie coiled in tangled masses in the right ventricle of the heart. The microfilariae circulate in the blood and are transmitted by mosquitoes.Humans are aberrant hosts for D. immitis, who probably become infected via contaminated mosquitoes. The parasites locate in the right ventricle but fail to mature and die. They are then swept into the pulmonary arteries where they impact and form the nidus of a thrombus. Most human cases are reported from the USA, Japan, and Australia. There is no proof that mature worms of D. immitis or their microfilariae ever develop in humans.D. tenuis is a subcutaneous parasite of the raccoon. Humans are an abnormal host, in whom gravid female worms have, on rare occasions, been found in the subcutaneous tissue, although without viable microfilariae outside the worm.D. repens is a subcutaneous parasite of dogs and cats in Europe, Africa, and Asia and probably accounts for incidental infections in humans in these areas.Both D. tenuis and D. repens are spread by mosquitos. Both parasites present as subcutaneous nodules which develop over several weeks and are variously tender, painful, red, and sometimes migratory. They develop in the conjunctiva, the eyelid, scrotum, breast, arms, or legs. Rarely, D. repens produces pulmonary lesions similar to D. immitis.[2]"DRACUNCULUS,"Dracunculus is a genus of spiruroid nematode parasites in the family Dracunculidae. Some species infest humans and alter their hostsê behaviour in a way that supports the wormês reproductive cycle. Dracunculus causes a blister to form on the host, often on the foot or lower leg, causing severe pain and a boiling sensation. This will cause the human host to dip the affected area in water to sooth the pain which will cause the blister to burst, allowing reproductive larvae into the water where they can await the next host to infect.The worms can reach a metre in length. If one simply pulls off the protruding head of the worm, the worm will break and leak high levels of foreign antigen which can lead to anaphylactic shock and fast death of the host. Hence it is important to remove the worm slowly (over a period of weeks). This is typically undertaken by winding the worm onto a stick (say, a matchstick), by a few centimetres each day."ECHINOCOCCUS,"The genus Echinococcus includes six parasite species of cyclophyllid tapeworms to date, of the family Taeniidae. Infection with Echinococcus results in hydatid disease, also known as echinococcosis.Echinococcus is triploblastic - it has three layers- outermost ectoderm, middle mesoderm, and inner endoderm. An anus is absent, and it has no digestive system. Its body is covered by tegument and the worm is divided into a scolex, a short neck, and three to six proglottids. Its body shape is ribbon-like.In humans, this causes a disease called echinococcosis. The three types of echinococcosis are cystic echinococcosis caused by E. granulosus, alveolar echinococcosis caused by E. multilocularis, and polycystic echinococcosis caused by E. vogeli or E. oligarthrus.[1] A worm'sincubation period is usually long and can be up to 50 years. Cystic echinococcosis is mostly found in South and Central America, Africa, the Middle East, China, Italy, Spain, Greece, Russia, and the western United States (Arizona, New Mexico, and California).Echinococcosis is a zoonosis; humans are dead-end hosts. The definitive hosts are carnivorous predators - dogs, wolves, foxes, and lions. The adult tapeworm lives in their small intestines and delivers eggs to be excreted with the stool. The intermediate hosts are infected by ingesting eggs. Sheep, goats, cattle, camels, pigs, wild herbivores, and rodents are the usual intermediate hosts, but humans can also be infected.The egg hatches in the digestive system of the intermediate host, producing a planula larva. It penetrates the intestinal wall and is carried by bloodstream to liver, lung, brain, or another organ. It settles there and turns into a bladder-like structure called hydatid cyst. From the inner lining of its wall, protoscoleces (i.e. scoleces with invaginated tissue layers) bud and protrude into the fluid filling the cyst.After the death of the normal intermediate host, its body can be eaten by carnivores suitable as definitive hosts. In their small intestines, protoscoleces turn inside out, attach, and give rise to adult tapeworms, completing the lifecycle. In humans, the cysts persist and grow for years. They are regularly found in the liver (and every possible organ: spleen, kidney, bone, brain, tongue and skin) and are asymptomatic until their growing size produces symptoms or are accidentally discovered. Disruption of the cysts (spontaneous or iatrogenic e.g. liver biopsy) can be life-threatening due to anaphylactic shock.Cysts are detected with ultrasound, X-ray computed tomography, or other imaging techniques. Antiechinococcus antibodies can be detected with serodiagnostic tests - indirect fluorescent antibody, complement fixation, ELISA, Western blot, and other methods.[2]"EDWARDSIELLA,"Edwardsiella is a Gram-negative, fermentative genus of bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae.[1] It was first discovered in snakes in 1962."EGGERTHELLA,"Eggerthella is a bacterial genus of Actinobacteria, in the family Coriobacteriaceae. Members of this genus are anaerobic, non-sporulating, non-motile, Gram-positive bacilli that grow singly, as pairs, or in short chains. They are found in the human colon and feces and have been implicated as a cause of ulcerative colitis, liver and anal abscesses and systemic bacteremia.[1][2]The type strain for this genus, Eggerthella lenta, was known as Eubacterium lentum prior to 1999.[3][4] The genus is named for Arnold Eggerth, who first described the organism in 1935.[5]"EHRLICHIA,"Ehrlichia is a genus of rickettsiales bacteria that is transmitted to vertebrates by ticks. This disease is considered zoonotic, because the main reservoir for the disease is animals.Ehrlichia are obligately intracellular pathogens and are transported between cells through the host cell filopodia during initial stages of infection, whereas, in the final stages of infection the pathogen ruptures the host cell membrane.[2]"EIKENELLA,"Eikenella corrodens is a fastidious Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus. It was first identified by M. Eiken in 1958, who called it Bacteroides corrodens.[1]"ELIZABETHKINGIA,"Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a Gram negative rod shaped bacteria widely distributed in nature (e.g. fresh water, salt water, or soil). It may be normally present in fish and frogs but is not normally present in the human microflora. In 1959 American bacteriologist Elizabeth O. King (who isolated Kingella in 1960), was studying unclassified pediatric-meningitis associated bacteria at the CDC in Atlanta, when she isolated an organism (CDC group IIa) that she named Flavobacterium meningosepticum (Flavobacterium means ""the yellow bacillus"" in Latin; meningosepticum likewise means ""associated with meningitis and sepsis"").[1] In 1994, it was reclassified in the genus Chryseobacterium and renamed Chryseobacterium meningosepticum[2](chryseos = ""golden"" in Greek, so Chryseobacterium means a golden/yellow rod similar to Flavobacterium). In 2005, a 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree of Chrysobacteria showed that C. meningosepticum along with C. miricola (which was reported to have been isolated from Russian space station Mir in 2001 and placed in the genus Chrysobacterium in 2003[3]) were close to each other but outside the tree of the rest of the Chryseobacteria and were then placed in a new genus Elizabethkingia named after the original discoverer of F. meningosepticum.[4]"EMPEDOBACTER,No entryENDOLIMAX,"Endolimax is a genus of amoebozoa[1] that are found in the intestines of various animals, including the species E. nana found in humans. Originally thought to be non-pathogenic, studies suggest it can cause intermittent or chronic diarrhea.[2][3] Additionally, it is very significant in medicine because it can provide false positives for other tests, notably the similar species Entamoeba histolytica, the pathogen responsible for amoebic dysentery, and because its presence indicates the host has consumed fecal material. It forms cysts with four nuclei which excyst in the body and become trophozoites. Endolimax nana nuclei have a large endosome somewhat off-center and small amounts of visible chromatin or none at all."ENGYDONTIUM,No entryENTAMOEBA,"Entamoeba is a genus of Amoebozoa found as internal parasites or commensals of animals.In 1875, Fedor Losch described the first proven case of amoebic dysentery in St Petersburg, Russia. He referred to the amoeba he observed microscopically as 'Amoeba coli'; however it is not clear whether he was using this as a descriptive term or intended it as a formal taxonomic name.[1] The genus Entamoeba was defined by Casagrandi and Barbagallo for the species Entamoeba coli, which is known to be a commensal organism.[2] Losch's organism was renamed Entamoeba histolytica by Fritz Schaudinn in 1903; he later died, in 1906, from a self-inflicted infection when studying this amoeba. For a time during the first half of the 20th century the entire genus Entamoeba was transferred to Endamoeba, a genus of amoebas infecting invertebrates about which little is known. This move was reversed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in the late 1950s, and Entamoeba has stayed 'stable' ever since."ENTEROBACTER,"Enterobacter is a genus of common Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Several strains of these bacteria are pathogenic and cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised (usually hospitalized) hosts and in those who are on mechanical ventilation. The urinary and respiratory tracts are the most common sites of infection. The genus Enterobacter is a member of the coliform group of bacteria. It does not belong to the fecal coliforms (or thermotolerant coliforms) group of bacteria, unlike Escherichia coli, because it is incapable of growth at 44.5 degrees C in the presence of bile salts. Some of them showed quorum sensing properties as reported before [1][2]Two clinically important species from this genus are E. aerogenes and E. cloacae."ENTEROBIUS,"The pinworm (genus Enterobius), also known as threadworm (in the United Kingdom and Australia) or seatworm, is a parasitic worm. It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common intestinal parasite or helminth, especially in humans.[5] The medical condition associated with pinworm infestation is known as enterobiasis[6] (a type of helminthiasis) or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae.[7]Throughout this article, the word ""pinworm"" refers to Enterobius. In British usage, however, pinworm refers to Strongyloides, while Enterobius is called threadworm.[8]"ENTEROCOCCUS,"Enterococcus is a large genus of lactic acid bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes. Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci that often occur in pairs (diplococci) or short chains, and are difficult to distinguish from streptococci on physical characteristics alone.[2] Two species are common commensal organisms in the intestines of humans: E. faecalis (90-95%) and E. faecium (5-10%). Rare clusters of infections occur with other species, including E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, and E. raffinosus.[2]"ENTEROVIRUS,"Enteroviruses are a genus of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses associated with several human and mammalian diseases. Serologic studies have distinguished 71 human enterovirus serotypes on the basis of antibody neutralization tests. Additional antigenic variants have been defined within several of the serotypes on the basis of reduced or nonreciprocal cross-neutralization between variant strains. On the basis of their pathogenesis in humans and animals, the enteroviruses were originally classified into four groups, polioviruses, Coxsackie A viruses (CA), Coxsackie B viruses (CB), and echoviruses, but it was quickly realized that there were significant overlaps in the biological properties of viruses in the different groups. Enteroviruses isolated more recently are named with a system of consecutive numbers: EV68, EV69, EV70, EV71, etc.[1]Enteroviruses affect millions of people worldwide each year, and are often found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) and stool of an infected person. Historically, poliomyelitis was the most significant disease caused by an enterovirus, poliovirus. There are 64 non-polio enteroviruses that can cause disease in humans: 23 Coxsackie A viruses, 6 Coxsackie B viruses, 28 echoviruses, and 5 other enteroviruses.[2] Poliovirus, as well as coxsackie and echovirus are spread through the fecal-oral route. Infection can result in a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild respiratory illness (common cold), hand, foot and mouth disease, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, severe neonatal sepsis-like disease, and acute flaccid paralysis.[2]"EPIDERMOPHYTON,"Epidermophyton is a genus of fungus causing superficial and cutaneous mycoses, including E. floccosum, and causes tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris (jock itch), tinea pedis (athleteês foot), and tinea unguium (fungal infection of the nail bed)."ERWINIA,"Erwinia is a genus of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria containing mostly plant pathogenic species which was named for the famous plant pathologist, Erwin Frink Smith. It contains gram-negative bacteria related to Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella and Yersinia. They are primarily rod-shaped bacteria.Many infect woody plants. A well-known member of this genus is the species E. amylovora, which causes fire blight on apples, pears, and other Rosaceae crops; E. tracheiphila on the other hand causes bacterial wilt of cucurbits. Other familiar species, such as E. carotovora (another major cause of plant diseases), are more distantly related to the fire blight bacterium, and been moved to genera Brenneria, Dickeya and Pectobacterium.[1] Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the secreted proteins of Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica revealed a low-abundance protein that was identified by mass spectrometry as a homologue of a Xanthomonas campestris avirulence protein with unknown function. The predicted Svx protein has an N-terminal signal sequence and zinc binding-region signature, and the mature protein is post-translationally modified. A 2D difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) showed that the protein is secreted by the type II (out) secretion apparatus, which is also responsible for the secretion of the major known virulence factors, PelC and CelV. Transcription of the svx gene is under Nacyl- homoserine lactone-mediated quorum-sensing control. The svx gene was inactivated by transposon insertion. The mutant showed a decrease in virulence in potato plant assays, demonstrating a role for Svx in the pathogenicity of E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica. These results show that Svx is a previously unidentified virulence determinant which is secreted by the out machinery and is regulated by quorum sensing, two systems employed by several other virulence factors. Thus, the type II secretory machine is a conduit for virulence factors other than the main pectinnases and cellulase in E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica.[2]"ERYSIPELOTHRIX,"Erysipelothrix is a genus of bacteria containing three species.[1] ""The hallmark of Erysipelothrix is the presence of a type B cell wall, in which the peptide bridge is formed between amino acids at positions 2 and 4 of adjacent peptide side-chains and not, as in the vast majority of bacteria, between amino acids at positions 3 and 4.""[1]The best known species is Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, which causes erysipelas of swine and other animal diseases. The other two species are apparently not pathogenic.[1] Erysipelothrix tonsillarum was described in 1987.[2] Erysipelothrix inopinata was described in 2004. These two species have been isolated from the tonsils of healthy pigs.[1] The new family Erysipelotrichidae was erected to contain this genus.[1]These bacteria are Gram-positive. They can be mistaken for Gram-negative bacteria during analysis because they lose their staining easily. They are not acid-fast. They are slender, nonmotile rod-shaped bacteria. They are straight or slightly curved and can appear long and filamentous. They exist singly, in V-shaped pairs, or in short chains. They are aerobic to facultatively anaerobic.[3]"ESCHERICHIA,"Escherichia is a genus of Gram-negative, non-spore forming, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae.[1] In those species which are inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tracts of warm-blooded animals, Escherichia species provide a portion of the microbially derived vitamin K for their host. A number of the species of Escherichia are pathogenic.[2] The genus is named after Theodor Escherich, the discoverer of Escherichia coli."EUBACTERIUM,"Eubacterium could be either a Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria genus in the family Eubacteriaceae. These bacteria are characterised by a rigid cell wall. They may either be motile or non-motile. If motile, they have a flagellum. A typical flagellum consists of a basal body, filament, and hook. The long filament is the organ which helps eubacteria move.Gram-positive bacteria have a thick proteoglycan layer and uptake violet gram-stain (whereas gram-negative bacteria have a thinner proteoglycan layer which is surrounded by a layer of immune-response-inducing lipopolysaccharide, and do not uptake gram-stain). Species from this genus have been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis.[2]"EWINGELLA,"Ewingella americana is a Gram-negative rod, and the only species in the genus Ewingella. It was first identified and characterized in 1983. Ewingella is in the family Enterobacteriaceae. The organism is rarely reported as a human pathogen, though it has been isolated from a variety of clinical specimens, including wounds, sputum, urine, stool, blood, synovial fluid,[1] conjunctiva and peritoneal dialysate.[2] The bacterium is named in honor of William H. Ewing, an American biologist who contributed to modern taxonomy."EXOPHIALA,"Exophiala is a genus of anamorphic fungi in the family Herpotrichiellaceae. The widespread genus contains 28 species.[3] The genus was formally described by J.W. Carmichael in 1966.[4]Exophiala has been implicated in causing 'Saxophone Lung' or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease that can be contracted by woodwind instrumentalists (saxophonists, clarinettists, oboists etc.). A case study presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology highlighted that it is possible to develop this allergic pulmonary disease through improper cleaning of instruments.[5][6]Exophiala werneckii is the organism responsible for tinea nigra.Some sources equate Hortaea werneckii, Cladosporium werneckii, Exophiala werneckii, and Phaeoannellomyces werneckii.[7]Exophiala jeanselmei causes maduromycosis.[8] This is usually an asymtomatic disease which presents with black or brown macular lesions which enlarge by peripheral extension. The lesion is darkest at the periphery and has very distinct margins. Lab diagnosis- using a KOH mount. Typically seen is brown septate branching hyphae or dark brown budding cells. Treatment is topical antifungal: miconazole or econazole."FACKLAMIA,No entryFASCIOLA,Fasciola is a genus of trematodes which includes economically important parasite species. Members of genus Fasciola belongs to liver flukes. They cause the disease fasciolosis.FILARIA,"The Filarioidea are a superfamily of nematodes (roundworms).[1][2] The members of this superfamily are known as filarial worms. Infections with parasitic filarial worms cause filariasis. Drugs against these worms are known as filaricides.It consists of seven families: Aproctidae, Creagrocercidae, Drilonematidae, Filariidae, Homungellidae, Mesidionematidae, Scolecophilidae, Setariidae (which has a single genus Setaria), and Ungellidae.[3]"FLAVIVIRUSES,"Flavivirus is a genus of viruses in the family Flaviviridae. This genus includes the West Nile virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, and several other viruses which may cause encephalitis.[2]Flaviviruses are named from the yellow fever virus, the type virus for the family; the word ""flavus"" means ""yellow"" in Latin. The name ""yellow fever"" originated from its propensity to cause yellow jaundice in victims.[3]Flaviviruses share several common aspects: common size (40-65 nm), symmetry (enveloped, icosahedral nucleocapsid), nucleic acid (positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 10,000-11,000 bases), and appearance in the electron microscope.Most of these viruses are transmitted by the bite from an infected arthropod (mosquito or tick) and hence, classified as arboviruses. Human infections with these viruses are typically incidental, as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titers to reinfect arthropods needed to continue the virus life cycle - man is a dead end host. The exceptions to this are yellow fever and dengue viruses, which still require mosquito vectors, but are well-enough adapted to humans as to not necessarily depend upon animal hosts (although both continue to have important animal transmission routes as well).Other virus transmission routes for arboviruses include handling infected animal carcasses, blood transfusion, child birth and through consumption of unpasteurised milk products. The transmission from animals to humans without an intermediate vector arthropod is thought to be unlikely. For example, early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not contagious.The known non-arboviruses of the flavivirus family either reproduce in arthropods or vertebrates, but not both."FLAVOBACTERIUM,"Flaviobacterium is a genus of Gram-negative, non-motile and motile, rod-shaped bacteria that consists of 130 recognized species (http://www.bacterio.net/flavobacterium.html),[1] as well as three newly proposed species (F. gondwanense,[2] F. salegens,[2] and F. scophthalmum[3]). Flavobacteria are found in soil and fresh water in a variety of environments. Several species are known to cause disease in freshwater fish.[4]Flaviobacterium psychrophilum causes the bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) on salmonids and the rainbow trout fry disease (RTFS) on rainbow trouts. Flaviobacterium columnare causes the cotton-wool disease on freshwater fishes. Flaviobacterium branchiophilum causes the bacterial gill disease (BGD) on trouts."FLAVONIFRACTOR,No entryFLEA,"Fleas are insects that form the order Siphonaptera. They are wingless, with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood. Fleas are external parasites, living by hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds.Flea species include:Cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis),Dog flea (Ctenocephalides canis),Human flea (Pulex irritans),Moorhen flea (Dasypsyllus gallinulae),Northern rat flea (Nosopsyllus fasciatus),Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis).Over 2,000 species have been described worldwide.[2]"FRANCISELLA,"Francisella is a genus of pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria. They are small coccobacillary or rod-shaped, nonmotile organisms, which are also facultative intracellular parasites of macrophages.[1] Strict aerobes, Francisella colonies bear a morphological resemblance to those of the genus Brucella.[2]The genus was named in honor of American bacteriologist Edward Francis, who, in 1922, first recognized F. tularensis (then named Bacterium tularensis) as the causative agent of tularemia.[3]"FUSARIUM,"Fusarium is a large genus of filamentous fungi, part of a group often referred to as hyphomycetes, widely distributed in soil and associated with plants. Most species are harmless saprobes, and are relatively abundant members of the soil microbial community. Some species produce mycotoxins in cereal crops that can affect human and animal health if they enter the food chain. The main toxins produced by these Fusarium species are fumonisins and trichothecenes.The name of Fusarium comes from Latin fusus, meaning a spindle."FUSOBACTERIUM,"Fusobacterium is a genus of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, similar to Bacteroides. Individual cells are rod-shaped bacilli with pointed ends.[1] Strains of Fusobacterium cause several human diseases, including periodontal diseases, Lemierre's syndrome, and topical skin ulcers.Although older sources state that Fusobacterium is part of the normal flora of the human oropharynx, the current consensus is that Fusobacterium should always be treated as a pathogen.[2] F. prausnitzii, a gut commensal associated with healthy patients, was moved out of Fusobacterium into its own genus, Faecalibacterium, in 2002."GARDNERELLA,"Gardnerella is a genus of Gram-variable-staining facultative anaerobic bacteria of which G. vaginalis is the only species. The organisms are small (1-1.5 micrometer diameter) non-spore forming, non-motile coccobacilli.Once classified as Haemophilus vaginalis and afterwards as Corynebacterium vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis grows as small, circular, convex, gray colonies on chocolate agar; it also grows on HBT agar. A selective medium for G. vaginalis is colistin-oxolinic acid blood agar."GEMELLA,"Gemella is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria that thrive best at high partial pressure of CO2. A Gemella species was first described as Neisseria hemolysans in 1938.[2] It was reclassified as a new genus in 1960 when strains were found to be distinct enough from Neisseria to require a new genus.[3] The name was suggested based on the organism being a diplococcus and gemellus is the diminutive of geminus,[4] which is latin for twin. They are facultatively anaerobic and give negative reactions to both oxidase and catalase tests. They are obligately fermentative, producing either a mixture of acetic and lactic acids or an equimolar molar mixture of acetic acid and CO2. For example, G. haemolysans ferments glucose forming a mixture of acetic and lactic acids in the absence of oxygen, whereas when oxygen is present, it forms acetic acid and CO2."GEOTRICHUM,"Geotrichum is a genus of fungi found worldwide in soil, water, air, and sewage, as well as in plants, cereals, and dairy products; it is also commonly found in normal human flora and is isolated from sputum and feces. It was first described in 1809 by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link.[1]The genus Geotrichum includes several species. The most clinical relevant is Saprochaeta capitata, formerly known as Geotrichum capitatum, with most cases occurring in Europe.[2][3]Saprochaete clavata, formerly known as Geotrichum clavatum, is an uncommon infection that has been associated with sporadic outbreaks.[4] Geotrichum candidum is closely related to Saprochaeta sp., rarely isolated but may cause invasive and disseminated disease with high mortality Yeast-like and mold-like strains have been identified.[5]The most important risk factor for invasive fungal infection related to Geotrichum is severe immunosuppression, especially in hematological malignancies as acute leukemia, associated with profound and prolonged neutropenia.[2][6]Fungemia is very common, often with deep organ involvement (lung, liver, spleen, and central nervous system) and also skin and mucous membranes lesions.[7] There is no optimal treatment for Geotrichum infections but based on existing data guidelines recommend amphotericin B with or without co administered flucytosine or with voriconazole showing good in vitro susceptibility.Mortality associated with Geotrichum-related infections is high, ranging from 57% to 80%.[8]Increasing the knowledge on Geotrichum related invasive fungal infections may improve early diagnosis and adequate treatment of these severe infections."GIARDIA,"Giardia is a genus of anaerobic flagellated protozoan parasites of the phylum Sarcomastigophora that colonise and reproduce in the small intestines of several vertebrates, causing giardiasis. Their life cycle alternates between an actively swimming trophozoite and an infective, resistant cyst. Giardia were first described by the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1681.[1] The genus is named after French zoologist Alfred Mathieu Giard.[2]"GLOBICATELLA,No entryGNATHOSTOMA,"Not to be confused with Gnathostomata (singular: Gnathostoma), a Vertebrate Superclass.Gnathostoma is a genus of parasitic nematodes. The species Gnathostoma spinigerum and Gnathostoma hispidum can cause gnathostomiasis."GORDONIA,"Gordonia is a genus of bacterium in the Actinobacteria, the same lineage that includes Mycobacterium tuberculosis.[1]"GRANULICATELLA,No entryHAEMOPHILUS,"Haemophilus is a genus of Gram-negative, pleomorphic, coccobacilli bacteria belonging to the Pasteurellaceae family.[1][2] While Haemophilus bacteria are typically small coccobacilli, they are categorized as pleomorphic bacteria because of the wide range of shapes they occasionally assume. The genus includes commensal organisms along with some significant pathogenic species such as H. influenzae-a cause of sepsis and bacterial meningitis in young children-and H. ducreyi, the causative agent of chancroid. All members are either aerobic or facultatively anaerobic."HAFNIA,"Hafnia is the genus of the Enterobacteriaceae family whose only species is the Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium Hafnia alvei.H. alvei is a commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract and not normally pathogenic, but may cause disease in immunocompromised patients. It is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, including the aminopenicillins.The name comes from Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen."HARTMANNELLA,Hartmannella is a genus of Amoebozoa.[3]HELCOCOCCUS,No entryHELICOBACTER,"Helicobacter is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria possessing a characteristic helical shape. They were initially considered to be members of the Campylobacter genus, but in 1989 Goodwin et al. published sufficient reasons to justify his new genus name of Helicobacter. [1] The Helicobacter genus contains about 35 species.[2][3][4]Some species have been found living in the lining of the upper gastrointestinal tract, as well as the liver of mammals and some birds.[5] The most widely known species of the genus is H. pylori, which infects up to 50% of the human population.[4] Some strains of this bacterium are pathogenic to humans as it is strongly associated with peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis, duodenitis, and stomach cancer. It also serves as the type species of the genus.Helicobacter species are able to thrive in the very acidic mammalian stomach by producing large quantities of the enzyme urease, which locally raises the pH from about 2 to a more biocompatible range of 6 to 7.[6] Bacteria belonging to this genus are usually susceptible to antibiotics such as penicillin, are microaerophilic (optimal oxygen concentration between 5 and 14%) capnophiles, and are fast-moving with their flagella.[7][8]"HELMINTHS OTHER NAMED,"Helminths, also commonly known as parasitic worms, are large multicellular organisms, which when mature can generally be seen with the naked eye. They are often referred to as intestinal worms even though not all helminths reside in the intestines; for example schistosomes are not intestinal worms, but rather reside in blood vessels.There is no clear consensus on the taxonomy of helminths; it is more of a commonly used term to describe certain worms with superficial similarities. These are flatworms (plathelminths) cestodes and trematodes, and (roundworms) nemathelminths (nematodes) - both of these are parasitic worm types - and the annelida, which is not parasitic or at the most ectoparasites like the leeches.[1]Many, but not all, of the worms referred to as helminths belong to the group of intestinal parasites. An infection by a helminth is known as helminthiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, helminth infection or intestinal worm infection. The same naming convention applies to all helminths whereby the ending ""-asis"" (or in veterinary science the ending ""-osis"") at the end of the name of the worm is added to signify the infection with that particular worm, for example Ascaris is the name of a particular helminth, and ascariasis is the name of the infectious disease caused by this helminth.Helminths are worm-like organisms living in and feeding on living hosts, receiving nourishment and protection while disrupting their hosts' nutrient absorption, causing weakness and disease. Those that live inside the digestive tract are called intestinal parasites. They can live inside humans and other animals. In their adult form, helminths cannot multiply in humans.[2] Helminths are able to survive in their mammalian hosts for many years due to their ability to manipulate the immune response by secreting immunomodulatory products.[3] Helminth ova (or eggs) have a strong shell that protects the eggs against a range of environmental conditions.Helminthology is the study of parasitic worms and their effects on their hosts. The word helminth comes from Greek helmins, a kind of worm."HEPATITIS VIRUSES,"Viral hepatitis is liver inflammation due to a viral infection.[1] It may present in acute (recent infection, relatively rapid onset) or chronic forms. The most common causes of viral hepatitis are the five unrelated hepatotropic viruses Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis D, and Hepatitis E. In addition to the nominal hepatitis viruses, other viruses that can also cause liver inflammation include Herpes simplex, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Yellow fever."HERPES VIRUSES,"Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), also known as human herpesvirus 1 and 2 (HHV-1 and HHV-2), are two members of the herpesvirus family, Herpesviridae, that infect humans.[1] Both HSV-1 (which produces most cold sores) and HSV-2 (which produces most genital herpes) are ubiquitous and contagious. They can be spread when an infected person is producing and shedding the virus. Herpes simplex can be spread through contact with saliva, such as sharing drinks.Symptoms of herpes simplex virus infection include watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes of the mouth, lips or genitals.[1] Lesions heal with a scab characteristic of herpetic disease. Sometimes, the viruses cause very mild or atypical symptoms during outbreaks. However, as neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses, HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system in the cell bodies of neurons. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience sporadic episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transported via the neuron's axon to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores.[2] It is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.[3]"HISTOPLASMA,"Histoplasma is a genus of dimorphic fungi commonly found in bird and bat fecal material.[1] Histoplasma contains a few species, includingãH. capsulatumãthe causative agent of histoplasmosis;[2] and Histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum (old term, Histoplasma farciminosum), causing epizootic lymphangitis in horses.[3] Histoplasma capsulatum is most prevalent in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. It was discovered by Samuel Taylor Darling in 1906."HOOKWORM,"Hookworm infection, also known as hookworm disease, is an infection by a parasitic bloodsucking roundworm. Hookworm infections include ancylostomiasis and necatoriasis. These worms live in the small intestine of their host, which may be a bird or a mammal such as a dog, cat, or human. Hookworm infection in pregnancy can cause retarded growth of the fetus, premature birth and a low birth weight. Hookworms in children can cause intellectual, cognitive and growth problems.Two species of hookworms commonly infect humans: Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. A. duodenale predominates in the Middle East, North Africa, India and (formerly) in southern Europe, while N. americanus predominates in the Americas, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, China, and Indonesia. A. tubaeforme infects cats, A. caninum infects dogs and A. braziliense and Uncinaria stenocephala infect both cats and dogs. Hookworms are much smaller than the giant roundworms Ascaris lumbricoides and so cause less tissue damage and obstruction. The most significant risk of hookworm infection is anemia, secondary to loss of iron (and protein) in the gut. The worms suck blood voraciously and damage the mucosa. However, the blood loss in the stools is not visibly apparent.Hookworm infection affects over half a billion people globally.[1] It is a leading cause of maternal and child morbidity in the developing countries of the tropics and subtropics. In developed countries, hookworm infection is rarely fatal, but anemia can be significant in a heavily infected individual. Hookworm infection is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis and therefore classified as a neglected tropical disease.[2] Ancylostomiasis is the disease caused when Ancylostoma duodenale hookworms, present in large numbers, produce an iron deficiency anemia by sucking blood from the host's intestinal walls."HUMAN METAPNEUMOVIRUS (HMPV),"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae and is closely related to the avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) subgroup C. It was isolated for the first time in 2001 in the Netherlands[1] by using the RAP-PCR (RNA arbitrarily primed PCR) technique for identification of unknown viruses growing in cultured cells. It may be the second most common cause (after the respiratory syncytial virus) of lower respiratory infection in young children.Compared with respiratory syncytial virus, infection with human metapneumovirus tends to occur in slightly older children and to produce disease that is less severe. Co-infection with both viruses can occur, and is generally associated with worse disease."HYMENOLEPIS,"Hymenolepis is a genus of cyclophyllid tapeworms responsible for hymenolepiasis. They are parasites of humans and other mammals. The focus in this article is in Hymenolepis commonly parasitizing humans.Species include:Hymenolepis apodemi - in rodentsHymenolepis asymetrica - in rodentsHymenolepis diminuta - in humansHymenolepis horrida - in rodentsHymenolepis rymzhanovi - in rodentsHymenolepis microstoma - in rodentsHymenolepis nana - in humans"HYPHOZYMA,No entryINFLUENZA VIRUS,"The Orthomyxoviruses are a family of RNA viruses that includes six genera: Influenza virus A, Influenza virus B, Influenza virus C, Isavirus, Thogotovirus and Quaranjavirus. The first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates, including birds (see also avian influenza), humans, and other mammals. Isaviruses infect salmon; the thogotoviruses are arboviruses, infecting vertebrates and invertebrates, such as ticks and mosquitoes.[2][3][4]The three genera of Influenza virus, which are identified by antigenic differences in their nucleoprotein and matrix protein, infect vertebrates as follows:Influenza virus A infects humans, other mammals, and birds, and causes all flu pandemicsInfluenza virus B infects humans and sealsInfluenza virus C infects humans, pigs and dogs."INQUILINUS,No entryIODAMOEBA,"Iodamoeba bôtschlii is a species of amoeba.[1]It gets its name from its appearance when stained with iodine.[2]Named for Otto Bôtschli by Prowazek in 1912, Iodamoeba bôtschlii is a nonpathogenic parasitic ameba, commonly found in the large intestines of people, pigs and other mammals.The distribution of I. bôtschlii is worldwide. Most likely to be the original host, pigs are often targeted with I. bôtschlii. I. bôtschlii is identified as a non-pathogenic parasite. Often, this parasite is mistaken as a pathogenic parasite because non-pathogenic and pathogenic parasites have the same characteristics. In terms of illnesses, humans have a low prevalence of I. bôtschlii (4-8%). I. butschlii is an indicator of oral-fecal contamination and humans may experience diarrhea.[3][4]"ISOSPORA,"Isospora is a genus of internal parasites classified under Coccidia.It is responsible for the condition isosporiasis, which causes acute, non-bloody diarrhoea in immunocompromised individuals."JAKOB-CREUTZFELD AGENT,No entryJANIBACTER,No entryJANTHINOBACTERIUM,"Janthinobacterium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria. The name is from Latin janthinus, which means ""violet"" or ""violet-blue"" + bacterium, which means rod or staff.[1]"KINGELLA,"Kingella kingae is a species of Gram-negative aerobic coccobacilli. First isolated in 1960, it was not recognized as a significant cause of infection in young children until the 1990s, when culture techniques had improved enough for it to be recognized. It is best known as a cause of septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, spondylodiscitis, bacteraemia, and endocarditis, and less frequently lower respiratory tract infections and meningitis.[1]There are four species of Kingella: K. kingae, the most common, is part of the bacterial flora of the throat in young children and is transmitted from child to child. When it causes disease, the clinical presentation is often subtle and preceded by a recent history of stomatitis or upper respiratory infection. Other species are K. indologenes, K. denitrificans both causing endocarditis, and K. oralis found in dental plaque.One notable exception is in cases of endocarditis (heart valve infection), which can be more refractory to treatment. K. kingae is the fifth member of the HACEK group of fastidious Gram-negative bacteria that cause endocarditis. Routine laboratory tests may be normal because the organism is difficult to culture. Inoculating the fluid from infected joints directly into blood culture vials can enhance the chances of an accurate culture, but extended culture times are not helpful.[2]The organism has also been known as Moraxella kingae.K. kingae is oxidase-positive, catalase-negative, and beta-hemolytic."KLEBSIELLA,"Klebsiella is a genus of non-motile, Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, rod-shaped bacteria with a prominent polysaccharide-based capsule.[1] It is named after the German microbiologist Edwin Klebs (1834-1913).Klebsiella species are found everywhere in nature. This is thought to be due to distinct sublineages developing specific niche adaptations, with associated biochemical adaptations which make them better suited to a particular environment. They can be found in water, soil, plants, insects, animals and humans.[2][3]"KLOECKERA,No entryKLUYVERA,No entryKOCURIA,"Kocuria is a genus of Gram positive bacteria in the phylum Actinobacteria, including the sequenced species Kocuria rhizophila."KOSERELLA,No entryKURTHIA,No entryLACTOBACILLUS,"Lactobacillus, is a genus of Gram-positive facultative anaerobic or microaerophilic rod-shaped bacteria.[1] They are a major part of the lactic acid bacteria group. In humans they are part of the vaginal microbiota.[2] Many species in this genus have had their genome sequenced.[3]"LACTOCOCCUS,"Lactococcus is a genus of lactic acid bacteria that were formerly included in the genus Streptococcus Group N1.[1] They are known as homofermentors meaning that they produce a single product, lactic acid in this case, as the major or only product of glucose fermentation. Their homofermentative character can be altered by adjusting cultural conditions such as pH, glucose concentration, and nutrient limitation. They are gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-motile cocci that are found singly, in pairs, or in chains. The genus contains strains known to grow at or below 7 degrees C.[2]Nine species of Lactococcus are currently recognized along with four subspecies.[3] They are:L. chungangensis,L. formosensis,L. fujiensis,L. garvieae,L. lactis (L. lactis subsp. cremoris,L. lactis subsp. hordniae,L. lactis subsp. lactis,L. lactis subsp. tructae),L. piscium,L. plantarum,L. raffinolactis,L. taiwanensis.These organisms are commonly used in the dairy industry in the manufacture of fermented dairy products such as cheeses. They can be used in single-strain starter cultures, or in mixed-strain cultures with other lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Streptococcus. Special interest is placed on the study of L. lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, as they are the strains used as starter cultures in industrial dairy fermentations.[4] Their main purpose in dairy production is the rapid acidification of milk; this causes a drop in the pH of the fermented product, which prevents the growth of spoilage bacteria. The bacteria also play a role in the flavor of the final product.[5] Lactococci are currently being used in the biotechnology industry. They are easily grown at industrial scale on whey-based media. As food-grade bacteria, they are used in the production of foreign proteins that are applied to the food industry."LECLERCIA,No entryLECYTHOPHORA,"Lecythophora hoffmannii, also known as Phialophora hoffmannii, is an ascomycete fungus that grows commonly in soil.[1] It has also been categorized as a soft-rot fungus capable of bringing the surface layer of timber into a state of decay, even when safeguarded with preservatives.[2] Additionally, it has pathogenic properties, although it causes serious infection only in rare cases.[3] A plant pathogen lacking a known sexual state,[4] L. hoffmannii has been classified as a ""dematiaceous fungus"" despite its contradictory lack of pigmentation; both in vivo and in vitro, there is no correlation between its appearance and its classification.[3]"LEGIONELLA,"The genus Legionella is a pathogenic group of Gram-negative bacteria that includes the species L. pneumophila, causing legionellosis[1] (all illnesses caused by Legionella) including a pneumonia-type illness called Legionnaires' disease and a mild flu-like illness called Pontiac fever.[1]It may be readily visualized with a silver stain. Legionella is common in many environments, including soil and aquatic systems, with at least 50 species and 70 serogroups identified.The side chains of the cell wall carry the bases responsible for the somatic antigen specificity of these organisms. The chemical composition of these side chains both with respect to components and arrangement of the different sugars determines the nature of the somatic or O antigen determinants, which are essential means of serologically classifying many Gram-negative bacteria.Legionella acquired its name after an outbreak of a then-unknown ""mystery disease"" sickened 221 persons, causing 34 deaths. The outbreak was first noticed among people attending a convention of the American Legionãan association of U.S. military veterans. The convention occurred in Philadelphia during the U.S. Bicentennial year in July 21-24, 1976. This epidemic among U.S. war veterans, occurring in the same city asãand within days of the 200th anniversary ofãthe signing of the Declaration of Independence, was widely publicized and caused great concern in the United States.[2]On January 18, 1977, the causative agent was identified as a previously unknown bacterium subsequently named Legionella. See Legionnaires' disease for full details."LEISHMANIA,"Leishmania is a genus of trypanosomes that are responsible for the disease leishmaniasis.[1][2] They are spread by sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus in the Old World, and of the genus Lutzomyia in the New World. At least 93 sandfly species are proven or probable vectors worldwide.[3] Their primary hosts are vertebrates; Leishmania commonly infects hyraxes, canids, rodents, and humans."LEMINORELLA,No entryLEPTOSPIRA,"Leptospira (Greek leptos, ""fine, thin"" and Latin spira, ""coil"")[1] is a genus of spirochaete bacteria, including a small number of pathogenic and saprophytic species.[2] Leptospira was first observed in 1907 in kidney tissue slices of a leptospirosis victim who was described as having died of ""yellow fever.""[3]"LEPTOTRICHIA,No entryLEUCONOSTOC,"Leuconostoc[1] is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria, placed within the family of Leuconostocaceae. They are generally ovoid cocci often forming chains. Leuconostoc spp. are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin and are catalase-negative (which distinguishes them from staphylococci). All species within this genus are heterofermentative and are able to produce dextran from sucrose. They are generally slime-forming.Blamed for causing the 'stink' when creating a sourdough starter, some species are also capable of causing human infection.[2] Because they are an uncommon cause of disease in humans, standard commercial identification kits are often unable to identify the organism.[3]Leuconostoc is, along with other lactic acid bacteria such as Pediococcus and Lactobacillus, responsible for the fermentation of cabbage, making it sauerkraut. It is similarly part of the symbiotic colonies of microbes involved in the fermentation of kefir, a fermented milk beverage.[4] In this process, the sugars in fresh cabbage are transformed to lactic acid which gives it a sour flavour and good keeping qualities."LISTERIA,"Listeria is a genus of bacteria that contains 10 species,[1][2] each containing two subspecies. Named after the English pioneer of sterile surgery Joseph Lister, the genus received its current name in 1940. Listeria species are gram-positive, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic, and non-spore forming.[3] The major human pathogen in the Listeria genus is L. monocytogenes. It is usually the causative agent of the relatively rare bacterial disease, listeriosis, a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacteria. The disease affects pregnant women, newborns, adults with weakened immune systems, and the elderly.Listeriosis is a serious disease for humans; the overt form of the disease has a case-fatality rate of about 20 percent. The two main clinical manifestations are sepsis and meningitis. Meningitis is often complicated by encephalitis, when it is known as meningoencephalitis, a pathology that is unusual for bacterial infections. Listeria ivanovii is a pathogen of mammals, specifically ruminants, and has rarely caused listeriosis in humans.[4]"LOUPING ILL,"Louping-ill (also known as Ovine Encephalomyelitis, Infectious Encephalomyelitis of Sheep, Trembling-ill) is an acute viral disease primarily of sheep that is characterized by a biphasic fever, depression, ataxia, muscular incoordination, tremors, posterior paralysis, coma, and death. Louping-ill is a tick-transmitted disease whose occurrence is closely related to the distribution of the primary vector, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus. It also causes disease in red grouse, and can affect humans. The name 'louping-ill' is derived from an old Scottish word describing the effect of the disease in sheep whereby they 'loup' or spring into the air.[1]"LOUSE,"Louse (plural: lice) is the common name for members of the order Phthiraptera, which contains nearly 5,000 species of wingless insect. Lice are obligate parasites, living externally on warm-blooded hosts which include every order of birds, and all the orders of mammals except for monotremes, pangolins, bats and cetaceans. Lice are the vectors of diseases such as typhus.Chewing lice live among the hairs or feathers of their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce their host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole life on a single host, cementing their eggs to hairs or feathers where they are known as ""nits"". The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.Humans host three species of louse, the head louse, the body louse and the pubic louse. The body louse has the smallest genome known for an insect; it has been used as a model organism and has been the subject of much research. Lice were ubiquitous in human society until at least the Middle Ages. They appear in folktales, songs such as The Kilkenny Louse House, and novels such as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis. A louse was one of the early subjects of microscopy, appearing in Robert Hooke's 1667 book, Micrographia."LUTEIMONAS,No entryMADURELLA,"Madurella is a genus of fungus of the Hyphomycetes class.According to MeSH, it is responsible for maduromycosis.[1]It has also been classified with the Mitosporic Ascomycota.It includes:Madurella griseaMadurella mycetomatis"MALASSEZIA,"Malassezia (formerly known as Pityrosporum) is a genus of fungi.

Micrococcus occurs in a wide range of environments, including water, dust, and soil. Micrococci have Gram-positive spherical cells ranging from about 0.5 to 3 micrometers in diameter and typically appear in tetrads. They are catalase positive, oxidase positive, indole negative and citrate negative. Micrococcus has a substantial cell wall, which may comprise as much as 50% of the cell mass. The genome of Micrococcus is rich in guanine and cytosine (GC), typically exhibiting 65 to 75% GC-content. Micrococci often carry plasmids (ranging from 1 to 100 MDa in size) that provide the organism with useful traits."MICROPOLYSPORA,"Micropolyspora is a defunct genus of bacteria within family Nocardiaceae. Members of this genus were transferred to new genera in families Nocardiaceae, Streptosporangiaceae and Pseudonocardiaceae.[1] These changes effectively ended the official status of this genus, but the name persists in older research articles, and is occasionally used in contemporary settings."MICROSPORIDIA,"The microsporidia constitute a phylum (Microspora) of spore-forming unicellular parasites. They were once thought to be protists but are now known to be fungi. Loosely 1500 of the probably more than one million[citation needed] species are named now. Microsporidia are restricted to animal hosts, and all major groups of animals host microsporidia. Most infect insects, but they are also responsible for common diseases of crustaceans and fish. The named species of microsporidia usually infect one host species or a group of closely related taxa. Several species, most of which are opportunistic, also infect humans.Approximately 10 percent of the species are parasites of vertebrates - including humans, in which they can cause microsporidiosis.After infection they influence their hosts in various ways and all organs and tissues are invaded, though generally by different species of microsporidia. Some species are lethal, and a few are used in biological control of insect pests. Parasitic castration, gigantism, or change of host sex are all potential effects of microsporidian parasitism (in insects). In the most advanced cases of parasitism the microsporidium rules the host cell completely and controls its metabolism and reproduction, forming a xenoma. .[1]Replication takes place within the host's cells, which are infected by means of unicellular spores. These vary from 1-40 micrometres, making them some of the smallest eukaryotes.[citation needed] Microsporidia that infect mammals are 1.0-4.0 micrometres.[2] They also have the smallest eukaryotic genomes.Microsporidium was once the vernacular name for a member of the class Microsporidea in the protozoan subphylum Cnidospora.[3]"MICROSPORUM,"Microsporum is a genus of fungi that causes tinea capitis, tinea corpus, ringworm, and other dermatophytoses (fungal infections of the skin). Microsporum forms both macroconidia (large asexual reproductive structures) and microconidia (smaller asexual reproductive structures) on short conidiophores. Macroconidia are hyaline, multiseptate, variable in form, fusiform, spindle-shaped to obovate, 7-20 by 30-160 micrometres in size, with thin or thick echinulate to verrucose cell walls. Their shape, size and cell wall features are important characteristics for species identification. Microconidia are hyaline, single-celled, pyriform to clavate, smooth-walled, 2.5-3.5 by 4-7 micrometres in size and are not diagnostic for any one species.The separation of this genus from Trichophyton is essentially based on the roughness of the macroconidial cell wall, although in practice this may sometimes be difficult to observe. Seventeen species of Microsporum have been described; however, only the more common species are included in these descriptions."MITE,"Mites, along with ticks, are small arthropods belonging to the subclass Acari (also known as Acarina) and the class Arachnida. The scientific discipline devoted to the study of ticks and mites is called acarology. In soil ecosystems, mites are favored by high organic matter content and by moist conditions, wherein they actively engage in the fragmentation and mixing of organic matter.[1]"MOBILUNCUS,"Mobiluncus is a genus of gram-negative,[1] anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria. While this species of bacterium possesses a cell wall with structural similarity to other gram-positive cell walls, upon gram stain these bacteria may be stained either gram-negative or gram-variable.Its organisms are found in the human vagina, particularly in association with Gardnerella vaginalis in cases of bacterial vaginosis.[2][3]"MOELLERELLA,No entryMOLLUSCUM CONTAGIOSUM VIRUS,"The Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a species of virus in the poxvirus family, which causes the disease Molluscum contagiosum in humans. Virions have a complex structure and is consistent with the structure of the poxvirus family: a surface membrane, a core, and lateral bodies. Virus may be contained within inclusion bodies and mature by budding through the membrane of the host cell giving rise to a large amount of viral shedding in a short period of time. Approximate measurements of the virus are 200 nm in diameter, 320 nm in length and 100 nm in height.[1]High magnification micrograph of molluscum contagiosum, showing the characteristic molluscum bodies which contain the virus.

MCV-1 is the most prevalent in human infections, and MCV-2 seen usually in adults and often sexually transmitted.[2][3][4] Polymerase chain reaction techniques are being developed to help confirm lesions as being caused by MCV,[5] and distinguish between strains.[6][7]"MORAXELLA,"Moraxella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria in the Moraxellaceae family. It is named after the Swiss ophthalmologist Victor Morax. The organisms are short rods, coccobacilli or, as in the case of Moraxella catarrhalis, diplococci in morphology, with asaccharolytic, oxidase-positive and catalase-positive properties.[2] Moraxella catarrhalis is the clinically most important species under this genus."MORGANELLA,"Morganella morganii is a species of Gram-negative bacteria.[1] It has a commensal relationship within the intestinal tracts of humans, mammals, and reptiles as normal flora.[1] Although M. morganii has a wide distribution, it is considered an uncommon cause of community-acquired infection and it is most often encountered in postoperative and other nosocomial infections such as urinary tract infections.[3]"MUCOR,"Mucor is a microbial genus of approximately 6 species of moulds commonly found in soil, digestive systems, plant surfaces, and rotten vegetable matter."MYCOBACTERIUM,"Mycobacterium is a genus of Actinobacteria, given its own family, the Mycobacteriaceae. The genus includes pathogens known to cause serious diseases in mammals, including tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and the classic Hansen's strain of leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae).[1] The Greek prefix myco- means ""fungus,"" alluding to the way mycobacteria have been observed to grow in a mold-like fashion on the surface of liquids when cultured.[2]"MYCOCLADUS,No entryMYCOLEPTODISCUS,Mycoleptodiscus is a genus of fungi in the family Magnaporthaceae.MYCOPLASMA,"Mycoplasma is a genus of bacteria that lack a cell wall around their cell membrane.[1] Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. They can be parasitic or saprotrophic. Several species are pathogenic in humans, including M. pneumoniae, which is an important cause of atypical pneumonia and other respiratory disorders, and M. genitalium, which is believed to be involved in pelvic inflammatory diseases. Mycoplasma species are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered,[2] can survive without oxygen, and are typically about 0.1  micrometres in diameter. Hundreds of mycoplasmae infect animals.[3]"MYROIDES,No entryNAEGLERIA,"Naegleria is a genus of protozoa. The genus was named after French zoologist Mathieu Naegler. Naegleria is a microscopic amoeba that can cause a very rare, but severe, infection of the brain. The amoeba is commonly found in warm freshwater (for example, lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil. Only one species, Naegleria fowleri infects humans.[1]Naegleria fowleri infects people by entering the body through the nose. This typically occurs when people go swimming or diving in warm freshwater places, like lakes and rivers. In very rare instances, Naegleria infections may also occur when contaminated water from other sources (such as inadequately chlorinated swimming pool water or heated tap water < 47 degree C) enters the nose. Once the amoeba enters the brain, it causes a usually fatal infection called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).[2] Naegleria are also notable because some species change their form based on the chemistry of their surroundings, transitioning from an immobile cell to a flagellated cell.The amoeba lives as a cyst on the sediments of the bottom of freshwater like lakes, ponds, and rivers.Species include:Naegleria fowleri, which causes a rare and generally fatal disease in humansNaegleria gruberiNaegleria lovaniensis"NECATOR,"Necator is a genus of fungus in the family Corticiaceae. The genus is monotypic, containing the single species Necator decretus, found in Southeast Asia.[1]"NEISSERIA,"Neisseria is a large genus of bacteria that colonize the mucosal surfaces of many animals. Of the 11 species that colonize humans, only two are pathogens, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. Most gonoccocal infections are asymptomatic and self-resolving, and epidemic strains of the meningococcus may be carried in >95% of a population where systemic disease occurs at <1% prevalence.Neisseria species are Gram-negative bacteria included among the proteobacteria, a large group of Gram-negative forms. Neisseria diplococci resemble coffee beans when viewed microscopically.[1]"NEMATODES UNSPECIFIED,No entryNEOSCYTALIDIUM,Neoscytalidium is a genus of fungi in the Botryosphaeriaceae family.NEW ORGANISM,No entryNIGROSPORA,No entryNOCARDIA,"Nocardia is a genus of weakly staining Gram-positive, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. It forms partially acid-fast beaded branching filaments (acting as fungi, but being truly bacteria). It contains a total of 85 species. Some species are nonpathogenic, while others are responsible for nocardiosis.[1] Nocardia species are found worldwide in soil rich in organic matter. In addition, they are oral microflora found in healthy gingiva, as well as periodontal pockets. Most Nocardia infections are acquired by inhalation of the bacteria or through traumatic introduction."NOROVIRUS,"Norovirus, sometimes known as the winter vomiting bug[1] in the UK, is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans. It affects people of all ages.[2] The virus is transmitted by fecally contaminated food or water, by person-to-person contact,[3] and via aerosolization of the virus and subsequent contamination of surfaces.[4] The virus affects around 267 million people and causes over 200,000 deaths each year; these deaths are usually in less developed countries and in the very young, elderly and immunosuppressed.[5]Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, projectile vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, and low-grade fever may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous and most who contract it make a full recovery within a couple of days.[1] Norovirus is rapidly inactivated by either sufficient heating or by chlorine-based disinfectants and polyquaternary amines, but the virus is less susceptible to alcohols and detergents.[6]After infection, immunity to norovirus is usually incomplete and temporary,[7] with one publication drawing the conclusion that protective immunity to the same strain of norovirus lasts for six months, but that all such immunity is gone after two years.[8] Outbreaks of norovirus infection often occur in closed or semiclosed communities, such as long-term care facilities, overnight camps, hospitals, schools, prisons, dormitories, and cruise ships, where the infection spreads very rapidly either by person-to-person transmission or through contaminated food.[9] Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by one infected person.[10]The genus name Norovirus is derived from Norwalk virus, the only species of the genus. The species causes approximately 90% of epidemic nonbacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world,[11] and may be responsible for 50% of all foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the United States.[12][13]"OCHROBACTRUM,"Ochrobactrum is a bacterial genus that belongs to Brucellaceae in the Rhizobiales. The genus has been described by Holmes in 1988 and Ochrobactrum anthropi was proposed as the type species of the genus. Further work led to the recognition of 16 other species, for a total of 18:Ochrobactrum anthropi,Ochrobactrum ciceri,Ochrobactrum cytisi,Ochrobactrum daejeonense,Ochrobactrum gallinifaecis,Ochrobactrum grignonense,Ochrobactrum guangzhouense,Ochrobactrum haematophilum,Ochrobactrum intermedium,Ochrobactrum lupini,Ochrobactrum oryzae,Ochrobactrum pecoris,Ochrobactrum pituitosum,Ochrobactrum pseudintermedium,Ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense,Ochrobactrum rhizosphaerae,Ochrobactrum thiophenivorans,Ochrobactrum tritici.The Ochrobactrum strains are all Gram-negative short rods, straight or slightly curved with one end flame shaped. The cells are approximately 0.6-1.2 to 2 micrometres in length. They are non-spore forming, strictly aerobic and non-fermentative.The genomes of most Ochrobactrum species is complex with two independent circular chromosomes often associated to plasmids."OERSKOVIA,No entryOLIGELLA,"Oligella is a genus of Gram-negative, aerobic bacteria from the family Alcaligenaceae."ONYCHOCOLA,No entryORF-PARAVACCINIA VIRUS,No entryOSCILLOSPIRA,No entryPAECILOMYCES,"Paecilomyces is a genus of nematophagous fungi which kills harmful nematodes by pathogenesis, causing disease in the nematodes.

The genus includes P. larvae, which is known to cause American foulbrood in honeybees, the P. polymyxa, which is capable of fixing nitrogen and therefore is used in agriculture and horticulture, the Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 which is known to be a rich source of chemical agents for biotechnology applications and pattern forming strains such as P. vortex and P. dendritiformis discovered in the early 90s,[9][10][11][12][13] which are known to develop complex colonies with intricate architectures[14][15][16][17][18] as is illustrated in the pictures."PANDORAEA,"Pandoraea is a genus of Gram-negative, nonspore-forming, motile bacteria with a single polar flagellum, of the family Burkholderiaceae and class Betaproteobacteria.[3][4]"PANTOEA,"Pantoea is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, recently separated from the Enterobacter genus. Pantoea bacteria ferment lactose, are motile, and form mucoid colonies. [1] This genus includes eight species and two sub-species. Besides that, some of the species show quorum sensing ability that could drive different gene expression hence controlling certain physiological activities [2]"PAPILLOMAVIRUS,"Papillomaviridae is an ancient taxonomic family of non-enveloped DNA viruses, collectively known as papillomaviruses. Several hundred species of papillomaviruses, traditionally referred to as ""types"",[1] have been identified infecting all carefully inspected mammals,[1] but also other amniotes such as birds, snakes and turtles.[2][3][4] Infection by most papillomavirus types, depending on the type, is either asymptomatic (e.g. most Beta-PVs) or causes small benign tumors, known as papillomas or warts (e.g. human papillomavirus1, HPV6 or HPV11). Papillomas caused by some types, however, such as human papillomaviruses 16 and 18, carry a risk of becoming cancerous.[5]Papillomaviruses are usually considered as highly host- and tissue-tropic, and are thought to rarely be transmitted between species.[6] Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in the basal layer of the body surface tissues. All known papillomavirus types infect a particular body surface,[1] typically the skin or mucosal epithelium of the genitals, anus, mouth, or airways.[7] For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) type 1 tends to infect the soles of the feet, and HPV type 2 the palms of the hands, where they may cause warts. Additionally, there are descriptions of the presence papillomavirus DNA in the blood and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Papillomaviruses were first identified in the early 20th century, when it was shown that skin warts, or papillomas, could be transmitted between individuals by a filterable infectious agent. In 1935 Francis Peyton Rous, who had previously demonstrated the existence of a cancer-causing sarcoma virus in chickens, went on to show that a papillomavirus could cause skin cancer in infected rabbits. This was the first demonstration that a virus could cause cancer in mammals."PAPOVAVIRUS,"A Papovavirus is any member of the former virus family of Papovaviridae.[1] They are mainly associated with various neoplasms in mammals.[1] The family of Papovaviridae is no longer used in recent taxonomy, but is split into the Papillomaviridae and the Polyomaviridae.[2]The name derives from three abbreviations: Pa for papillomavirus, Po for polyomavirus, and Va for ""vacuolating"" (simian vacuolating virus 40 or SV40, which is now known to be part of the polyomavirus genus).Papovaviruses are DNA viruses containing double-stranded DNA, are icosahedral in shape, and do not have a lipoprotein envelope.They are commonly found in humans and other species, mostly mammals. The one that most often causes disease in humans is the human papillomavirus."PARABACTEROIDES,No entryPARACOCCIDIOIDES,Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus and the causative agent of the disease paracoccidioidomycosis.[1][2][3] The fungus has been affiliated with the family Ajellomycetaceae (division Ascomycota) although a sexual state or teleomorph has not yet been found.[4]PARACOCCUS,"In taxonomy, Paracoccus is a genus of the Rhodobacteraceae.[1]"PARAGONIMUS,"Paragonimus is a genus of flatworms (platyhelminths). Some tens of species have been described, but they are difficult to distinguish, so it is not clear how many of the named species may be synonyms. Several of the species are known as lung flukes. In humans some of the species occur as zoonoses; the term for the condition is paragonimiasis. The first intermediate hosts of Paragonimus include at least 54 species of freshwater snails from superfamilies Cerithioidea and Rissooidea.[2]The most prominent species of Paragonimus in human medicine is Paragonimus westermani, an infectious lung fluke originating in eastern Asia. Worldwide, about nine species of Paragonimus are known to cause human paragonimiasis in which many of the species reside in East Asia, West Africa, and in North and South America.[3]"PARALYTIC SHELLFISH POISONING,"Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is one of the four recognized syndromes of shellfish poisoning, which share some common features and are primarily associated with bivalve mollusks (such as mussels, clams, oysters and scallops). These shellfish are filter feeders and, therefore, accumulate neurotoxins, called saxitoxin, produced by microscopic algae, such as dinoflagellates, diatoms, and cyanobacteria.[1] Dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium (genus) are the most numerous and widespread saxitoxin producers and are responsible for PSP blooms in subarctic, temperate, and tropical locations.[2] The majority of toxic blooms have been caused by the morphospecies Alexandrium catenella, Alexandrium tamarense, and Alexandrium fundyense,[3] which together comprise the A. tamarense species complex.[4] In Asia, PSP is mostly associated with the occurrence of the species Pyrodinium bahamense.[5] Human toxicity and mortality can occur after ingestion of these animals, but toxicity is also seen in wild animal populations.Also some pufferfish, including Chamaeleon puffer, contain saxitoxin, making their consumption hazardous.[6]"PARAMYXOVIRUSES,"Paramyxoviridae (from Greek para-, beyond, -myxo-, mucus or slime, plus virus, from Latin poison, slime) is a family of viruses in the order Mononegavirales. Human, vertebrates, and birds serve as natural hosts. There are currently 36 species in this family, divided among 18 genera. Diseases associated with this negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus family include: measles, mumps, respiratory tract infections.[1][2][3]"PARECHOVIRUS,"Parechovirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Picornaviridae. Bank voles and humans serve as natural hosts. There are currently only two species in this genus including the type species Parechovirus A, also called human parechoviruses and Parechovirus B, more commonly known as the Ljungan virus.[1] Diseases associated with this genus include: human parechoviruses: mild, gastrointestinal or respiratory illness, have been implicated in cases of myocarditis and encephalitis; Ljungan virus: may be a zoonotic virus associated with diabetes and intrauterine fetal death in human. [2][3]"PARVIMONAS,No entryPARVOVIRUS B19,"Primate erythroparvovirus 1, generally referred to as B19 virus, parvovirus B19[1] or sometimes erythrovirus B19,[2] was the first (and until 2005 the only) known human virus in the family Parvoviridae, genus Erythroparvovirus; it measures only 23-26 nm in diameter.[3] The name is derived from Latin, parvum meaning small, reflecting the fact that B19 ranks among the smallest DNA viruses. B19 virus is most known for causing disease in the pediatric population; however, it can also affect adults. It is the classic cause of the childhood rash called fifth disease or erythema infectiosum, or ""slapped cheek syndrome."" [4][5]The virus was discovered by chance in 1975 by Australian virologist Yvonne Cossart.[5][6] It gained its name because it was discovered in well B19 of a large series of microtiter plates labelled in this way.[5][7]"PASTEURELLA,"Pasteurella is a genus of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria.[1][2] Pasteurella species are nonmotile and pleomorphic. Most species are catalase- and oxidase-positive.[3] The genus is named after the French chemist and microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, who first identified the bacteria now known as Pasteurella multocida as the agent of chicken cholera."PEDIOCOCCUS,"Pediococcus is a genus of Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria, placed within the family of Lactobacillaceae. They usually occur in pairs or tetrads, and divide along two planes of symmetry, as do the other lactic acid cocci genera Aerococcus and Tetragenococcus. They are purely homofermentative. Pediococcus dextrinicus has recently been reassigned to the genus Lactobacillus.[1]"PENICILLIUM,"Penicillium is a genus of ascomycetous fungi of major importance in the natural environment as well as food and drug production.Some members of the genus produce penicillin, a molecule that is used as an antibiotic, which kills or stops the growth of certain kinds of bacteria inside the body. Other species are used in cheesemaking. According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), the widespread genus contains over 300 species"PEPTOCOCCUS,"Peptococcus is a Gram-positive bacterium genus in the family Peptococcaceae.Species in the genus are part of the human microbiome, especially in the bacteria that form the gut flora. They are part of the flora of the mouth, upper respiratory tract and large intestine.Mezlocillin is an antibiotic that is effective against Peptococcus species.Peptococcus magnus is a human pathogen.[1]"PEPTONIPHILUS,Peptoniphilus is a genus of bacteria in the phylum Firmicutes (Bacteria).[1]PEPTOSTREPTOCOCCUS,"Peptostreptococcus is a genus of anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore forming bacteria. The cells are small, spherical, and can occur in short chains, in pairs or individually.[1] Peptostreptococcus are slow-growing bacteria with increasing resistance to antimicrobial drugs.[2]The most frequently identified species of Peptostreptococcus is P. magnus."PHAEOSPHAERIA,Phaeosphaeria is a genus of fungi in the family Phaeosphaeriaceae.[1]PHIALEMONIUM,Phialemonium is a genus of fungi in the family Cephalothecaceae of the Ascomycota. The genus was circumscribed by Walter Gams and Michael McGinnis in 1983. The genus is intermediate between Acremonium and Phialophora.[1]PHIALOPHORA,"Phialophora is a form genus of fungus with short conidiophores, sometimes reduced to phialides; their conidia are unicellular. They may be parasites (including on humans), or saprophytic (including on apples).[3][4]Genetic analysis of Phialophora shows that it is a paraphyletic grouping.[5]The conidia are produced from a flask shaped phialide. Mature, spherical, to oval conidia are extruded from phialides and usually accumulate around it."PHOMA,Phoma is a genus of common coelomycetous soil fungi. It contains many plant pathogenic species.PICHIA,"Pichia (Hansenula and Hyphopichia are obsolete synonyms) is a genus of yeasts in the family Saccharomycetaceae with spherical, elliptical or oblong acuminate cells. Pichia is a teleomorph, and forms hat-shaped, hemispherical, or round ascospores during sexual reproduction. The anamorphs of some Pichia species are Candida species. The asexual reproduction is by multilateral budding.Lactose is neither fermented nor assimilated by this species. The behavior with regard to other carbohydrates is dependent on the different species. Nitrate is always assimilated.More than 100 species of this genus are known. Some of them interfere with the fermentation process for alcohol production. In winemaking, some species of Pichia can create potential faults in wines.[1] Most are found in decaying plants; some live in close symbiosis with insects, which live on decaying plants.Some Pichia representatives can be found in raw milk and cheese, such as P. anomala (formerly named Hansenula anomala). P. anomala has been shown to combat the undesirable mold Aspergillus flavus, which contaminates food sources such as tree nuts and corn, and produces aflatoxins. Researchers of the Agricultural Research Service found that when pistachio trees were treated with P. anomala, the growth of A. flavus was inhibited up to 97%. In addition to inhibiting A. flavus, the yeast may also help protect other agricultural crops from unwanted molds that affect the cropes taste, texture, yield, and safety. [1] In smeared-surface ripened cheese, the most important species is P. membranifaciens that also occurs on cream cheese. The formation of a so-called pellicle is typical. Another member of the genus, P. pastoris, is widely used in molecular biology and biotechnology as an expression system. P. angusta furthermore called Hansenula polymorpha or H. polymorpha, is a model organism for studying the functions of peroxisomes and their underlying molecular biology.Some Pichia species (e.g. P. ohmeri) have recently been clinically been proven to be pathogens, better known as so-called opportunistic pathogens [2] in immunocompromised humans."PLASMODIUM,"Plasmodium, commonly known as the malaria parasite, is a large genus of parasitic protozoa. As with some other genera of clinically important microorganisms, the genus name also yields a common noun; thus species of the genus are known as plasmodia. Infection with plasmodia is known as malaria, a deadly disease widespread in the tropics.The parasite always has two hosts in its life cycle: a mosquito vector and a vertebrate host. The life-cycle is very complex, involving a sequence of different stages both in the vector and the host. These stages include sporozoites which are injected by the mosquito vector into the host's blood; latent hypnozoites which may rest undetected in the liver for up to 30 years; merosomes and merozoites which infect the red cells (erythrocytes) of the blood; trophozoites which grow in the red cells, and schizonts which divide there, producing more merozoites which leave to infect more red cells; and male and female sexual forms, gametocytes, which are taken up by other mosquitoes. In the mosquito's midgut, the gametocytes develop into gametes which fertilize each other to form motile zygotes which escape the gut, only to grow into new sporozoites which move to the mosquito's salivary glands, from where they are injected into the mosquito's next host, infecting it and restarting the cycle.The genus Plasmodium was first described in 1885. It now contains about 200 species divided into several subgenera; as of 2006 the taxonomy was shifting, and species from other genera are likely to be added to Plasmodium. At least ten species infect humans; other species infect other animals, including birds, reptiles and rodents, while 29 species infect non-human primates. The parasite is thought to have originated from Dinoflagellates, photosynthetic protozoa.The most common forms of human malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, and P. malariae. P. falciparum, common in sub-Saharan Africa, and P. knowlesi, common in Southeast Asia, are especially dangerous."PLESIOMONAS,"Plesiomonas shigelloides is a species of bacteria.[1] It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium which has been isolated from freshwater, freshwater fish, and shellfish and from many types of animals including cattle, goats, swine, cats, dogs, monkeys, vultures, snakes, and toads.Infections from this organism cause gastroenteritis, followed by septicemia in immune deficient patients. It is placed among the Enterobacteriaceae. Some Plesiomonas strains share antigens with Shigella sonnei, and cross-reactions with Shigella antisera occur. Plesiomonas can be distinguished from Shigella in diarrheal stools by an oxidase test: Plesiomonas is oxidase positive and Shigella is oxidase negative. Plesiomonas is negative for DNAse; this and other biochemical tests distinguish it from Aeromonas sp."PNEUMOCYSTIS,"Pneumocystidomycetes is a class of ascomycete fungi. It includes the single order Pneumocystidales, which contains the single monotypic family Pneumocystidaceae, which in turn contains the genus Pneumocystis."POLYOMAVIRUS,"Polyomaviridae is a family of viruses. Mammals and birds serve as natural hosts. There are currently 13 species in this family, divided among 1 genera, Polyomavirus (type species Simian virus 40). Diseases associated with this family include: JCPyV: progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; BKPyV: mild respiratory infection.[1][2] They are potentially oncogenic (tumor-causing); they often persist as latent infections in a host without causing disease, but may produce tumors in a host of a different species, or a host with an ineffective immune system. The name polyoma refers to the viruses' ability to produce multiple (poly-) tumors (-oma).The family Polyomaviridae came from a split of the now obsolete family Papovaviridae (the other family being Papillomaviridae).[2] The name Papovaviridae derived from three abbreviations: Pa for Papillomavirus, Po for Polyomavirus, and Va for ""vacuolating."" Clinically, Polyomaviridae are relevant as they contribute to pathologies such as Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (JC virus), nephropathy (BK virus), and Merkel cell cancer (Merkel cell virus)."PORPHYROMONAS,"Porphyromonas gingivalis belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and is a nonmotile, Gram-negative, rod-shaped, anaerobic, pathogenic bacterium. It forms black colonies on blood agar.It is found in the oral cavity, where it is implicated in certain forms of periodontal disease,[1] as well as the upper gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and in the colon. It has also been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis.[2] Collagen degradation observed in chronic periodontal disease results in part from the collagenase enzymes of this species. It has been shown in an in vitro study that P. gingivalis can invade human gingival fibroblasts and can survive in them in the presence of considerable concentrations of antibiotics.[3] P. gingivalis also invades gingival epithelial cells in high numbers, in which cases both bacteria and epithelial cells survive for extended periods of time. High levels of specific antibodies can be detected in patients harboring P. gingivalis.In addition, P. gingivalis has been linked to rheumatoid arthritis. It contains the enzyme peptidyl-arginine deiminase, which is involved in citrullination.[4] Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased incidence of periodontal disease[citation needed] and antibodies against the bacterium are significantly more common in these patients.[5]P. gingivalis is divided into K-serotypes based upon capsular antigenicity of the various types.[6]"PREVOTELLA,"Prevotella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria.Bacteroides melaninogenicus has been reclassified and split into Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella intermedia.[1]Prevotella spp. are members of the oral and vaginal flora, and are recovered from anaerobic infections of the respiratory tract. These infections include aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, pulmonary empyema, and chronic otitis media and sinusitis. They have been isolated from abscesses and burns in the vicinity of the mouth, bites, paronychia, urinary tract infection, brain abscesses, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia associated with upper respiratory tract infections. Prevotella spp. predominate in periodontal disease and periodontal abscesses. [2]In a study of gut bacteria of children in Burkina Faso (in Africa), Prevotella made up 53% of the gut bacteria, but were absent in age-matched European children.[3] Studies also indicate that long-term diet is strongly associated with the gut microbiome composition_those who eat plenty of protein and animal fats typical of Western diet have predominantly Bacteroides bacteria, while for those who consume more carbohydrates, especially fibre, the Prevotella species dominate.[4]P. copri is possibly connected to rheumatoid arthritis.[5]A recent study on Prevotella derived from humans compared the gene repertoires of its species derived from different body sites of human. It also reported an open pan- genome showing vast diversity of gene pool. [6]"PROPIONIBACTERIUM,"Propionibacterium is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped genus of bacteria named for their unique metabolism: They are able to synthesize propionic acid by using unusual transcarboxylase enzymes.[3]Its members are primarily facultative parasites and commensals of humans and other animals, living in and around the sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and other areas of the skin. They are virtually ubiquitous and do not cause problems for most people, but propionibacteria have been implicated in acne and other skin conditions.[4] One study found the Propionibacterium was the most prevalent human skin-associated genus of microorganisms.[5]Members of the genus Propionibacterium are widely used in the production of vitamin B12, tetrapyrrole compounds, and propionic acid, as well as in the probiotics and cheese industries.[6]The strain Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii is used in cheesemaking to create CO2 bubbles that become ""eyes""ãround holes in the cheese.[7]"PROTEUS,"Proteus is a genus of Gram-negative Proteobacteria. Proteus bacilli are widely distributed in nature as saprophytes, being found in decomposing animal matter, sewage, manure soil, and human and animal feces.

Ralston."RAOULTELLA,"The genus Raoultella is composed of Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, aerobic, nonmotile, capsulated, facultatively anaerobic rods (formerly designated Klebsiella) in the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is named after the French bacteriologist Didier Raoult.[1]Members of genus Raoultella grow at 10degree C consistent with their recovery from plants, soil, and water, whereas members of Klebsiella (Klebsiella oxytoca is an exception, and a proposal to classify K. oxytoca in a separate, unnamed genus has been made.)[2] do not grow at 10degree C and are mainly recovered from mammals' mucosae.[citation needed]It consists of species Raoultella ornitholytica, Raoultella planticola and Raoultella terrigena.[3]A phylogenetic tree of Klebsiella, based on a 2.93-Mbp alignment, unambiguously places R. ornitholytica sister to K. oxytoca within the larger Klebsiella phylogeny and suggests abandoning the Raoultella genus designation.[4]"REOVIRUSES,"Reoviridae is a family of viruses. They have a wide host range, including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and fungi.[1] There are currently 87 species in this family, divided among 30 genera.[2] Reoviruses can affect the gastrointestinal system (such as Rotavirus) and respiratory tract.[3] The name ""Reo-"" is derived from respiratory enteric orphan viruses.[4] The term ""orphan virus"" refers to the fact that some of these viruses have been observed not associated with any known disease. Even though viruses in the Reoviridae family have more recently been identified with various diseases, the original name is still used.Reovirus infection occurs often in humans, but most cases are mild or subclinical. Rotavirus, however, can cause severe diarrhea and intestinal distress in children. The virus can be readily detected in feces, and may also be recovered from pharyngeal or nasal secretions, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood. Despite the ease of finding Reovirus in clinical specimens, their role in human disease or treatment is still uncertain.Some viruses of this family infect plants. For example, Phytoreovirus and Oryzavirus."RHINOCLADIELLA,No entryRHINOVIRUS,"Rhinoviruses (from the Greek (gen.) ""nose"") are the most common viral infectious agents in humans and are the predominant cause of the common cold. Rhinovirus infection proliferates in temperatures between 33-35 degrees C, the temperatures found in the nose. Rhinoviruses consist of three species in the genus Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family of viruses.There are 99 recognized types of human rhinoviruses that differ according to their surface proteins. They are lytic in nature and are among the smallest viruses, with diameters of about 30 nanometers. By comparison, other viruses such as smallpox and vaccinia are around 10 times larger at about 300 nanometers."RHIZOBIUM,"Rhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen. Rhizobium forms an endosymbiotic nitrogen fixing association with roots of legumes and Parasponia.The bacteria colonize plant cells within root nodules; here the bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia and then provide organic nitrogenous compounds such as glutamine or ureides to the plant. The plant provides the bacteria with organic compounds made by photosynthesis.[2]"RHIZOMUCOR,"Rhizomucor is a genus of fungi in the Mucoraceae family. The widespread genus contains six species.[1] Rhizomucor parasiticus, the species originally selected as the type, is now considered synonymous with Rhizomucor pusillus.[2]"RHIZOPUS,"Rhizopus is a genus of common saprophytic fungi on plants and specialized parasites on animals. They are found on a wide variety of organic substrates, including ""mature fruits and vegetables"",[2] jellies, syrups, leather, bread, peanuts, and tobacco. Some Rhizopus species are opportunistic agents of human zygomycosis (fungal infection) and can be fatal. Rhizopus infections may also be a complication of diabetic ketoacidosis.[3] This widespread genus includes at least eight species.[4][5]Rhizopus species grow as filamentous, branching hyphae that generally lack cross-walls (i.e., they are coenocytic). They reproduce by forming asexual and sexual spores. In asexual reproduction, sporangiospores are produced inside a spherical structure, the sporangium. Sporangia are supported by a large apophysate columella atop a long stalk, the sporangiophore. Sporangiophores arise among distinctive, root-like rhizoids. In sexual reproduction, a dark zygospore is produced at the point where two compatible mycelia fuse. Upon germination, a zygospore produces colonies that are genetically different from either parent.R. microsporus var. oligosporus is used to make tempeh, a fermented food derived from soybeans.R. oryzae is used in the production of alcoholic beverages in parts of Asia and Africa.Rhizopus stolonifer (black bread mold) causes fruit rot on strawberry, tomato, and sweet potato and used in commercial production of fumaric acid and cortisone.Various species, including R. stolonifer, may cause soft rot in sweet potatoes and Narcissus."RHODOCOCCUS,"Rhodococcus is a genus of aerobic, nonsporulating, nonmotile Gram-positive bacteria closely related to Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium.[1][2] While a few species are pathogenic, most are benign, and have been found to thrive in a broad range of environments, including soil, water, and eukaryotic cells. Fully sequenced in October 2006, the genome is known to be 9.7 megabasepairs long and 67% G/C.[3]Strains of Rhodococcus are important owing to their ability to catabolize a wide range of compounds and produce bioactive steroids, acrylamide, and acrylic acid, and their involvement in fossil fuel biodesulfurization.[3] This genetic and catabolic diversity is not only due to the large bacterial chromosome, but also to the presence of three large linear plasmids.[1] Rhodococcus is also an experimentally advantageous system owing to a relatively fast growth rate and simple developmental cycle, but is not well characterized.[3]Another important application of Rhodococcus comes from bioconversion, using biological systems to convert cheap starting material into more valuable compounds, such as its ability to metabolize harmful environmental pollutants, including toluene, naphthalene, herbicides, and PCBs. Rhodococcus species typically metabolize aromatic substrates by first oxygenating the aromatic ring to form a diol (two alcohol groups). Then, the ring is cleaved with intra/extradiol mechanisms, opening the ring and exposing the substrate to further metabolism. Since the chemistry is very stereospecific, the diols are created with predictable chirality. While controlling the chirality of chemical reaction presents a significant challenge for synthetic chemists, biological processes can be used instead to faithfully produce chiral molecules in cases where direct chemical synthesis is not feasible or efficient. An example of this is the use of Rhodococcus to produce indene, a precursor to the AIDS drug indinavir, a protease inhibitor, and containing two of the five chiral centers needed in the complex.[4]"RHODOTORULA,"Rhodotorula is a genus of unicellular pigmented yeasts, part of the division Basidiomycota. It is readily identifiable by distinctive orange/red colonies when grown on SDA (Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar). This distinctive color is the result of pigments that the yeast creates to block out certain wavelengths of light that would otherwise be damaging to the cell."RICKETTSIA,"Rickettsia is a genus of nonmotile, Gram-negative, nonspore-forming, highly pleomorphic bacteria that can present as cocci (0.1 micrometres in diameter), rods (1-4 micrometres long), or thread-like (10 micrometres long). Being obligate intracellular parasites, the Rickettsia survival depends on entry, growth, and replication within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells (typically endothelial cells).[8]Because of this, Rickettsia cannot live in artificial nutrient environments and is grown either in tissue or embryo cultures (typically, chicken embryos are used). In the past, it was positioned somewhere between viruses and true bacteria. However, unlike Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Ureaplasma, rickettsial organisms possess true cell walls similar to other Gram-negative bacteria.[9] The majority of Rickettsia bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics of the tetracycline group.Despite the similar name, Rickettsia bacteria do not cause rickets, which is a result of vitamin D deficiency. Instead, they are named after Howard Taylor Ricketts.Rickettsia species are carried by many arthropods, including chiggers, ticks, fleas, and lice, and cause diseases in humans such as typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus).[10] They have also been associated with a range of plant diseases. The name rickettsia is often used for any member of the Rickettsiales. They are one of closest living relatives to the bacteria that were the origin of the mitochondria organelles that exist inside most eukaryotic cells.The method of growing Rickettsia in chicken embryos was invented by Ernest William Goodpasture and his colleagues at Vanderbilt University in the early 1930s."ROBINSONIELLA,No entryROSEOMONAS,No entryROTHIA,No entryRUBELLA VIRUS,"Rubella virus (RuV) is the pathogenic agent of the disease rubella, and is the cause of congenital rubella syndrome when infection occurs during the first weeks of pregnancy.Rubella virus is the only member of the genus Rubivirus and belongs to the family of Togaviridae, whose members commonly have a genome of single-stranded RNA of positive polarity which is enclosed by an icosahedral capsid.The molecular basis for the causation of congenital rubella syndrome are not yet completely clear, but in vitro studies with cell lines showed that rubella virus has an apoptotic effect on certain cell types. There is evidence for a p53-dependent mechanism.[1]"RUMINOCOCCUS,"Ruminococcus is a genus of bacteria in the class Clostridia. They are anaerobic, Gram-positive gut microbes. One or more species in this genus are found in significant numbers in the intestines of humans. The type species is R. flavefaciens. As usual, bacteria taxonomy is in flux, with Clostridia being paraphyletic, and some erroneous members of Ruminococcus being reassigned to a new genus Blautia on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences.[1]"SACCHAROMYCES,"Saccharomyces is a genus in the kingdom of fungi that includes many species of yeast. Saccharomyces is from Greek sugar and mushroom and means sugar fungus. Many members of this genus are considered very important in food production. It is known as the brewer's yeast or baker's yeast. They are unicellular and saprophytic fungi. One example is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is used in making wine, bread, and beer. Other members of this genus include the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus that is the closest relative to S. cerevisiae, Saccharomyces bayanus, used in making wine, and Saccharomyces boulardii, used in medicine."SACCHAROPOLYSPORA,Saccharopolyspora is a genus of bacteria within the family Pseudonocardiaceae.SAGENOMELLA,"Sagenomella is a genus of filamentous Ascomycota fungus that has reported to cause systemic illness in animals. The genus was circumscribed by Walter Gams in 1978.[1]Sagenomella chlamydospora has been reported to cause a systemic illness in dogs.[2]They are normally considered a non-dermatophytic fungi.[3] Both skeletal and visceral phaeohyphomycosis due to granuloma formation have been reported, and iatrogenic infections associated with wound dehiscence is common. Clinical signs of Sagenomella spp. infections are often vague and most cases cited report sudden death as a consistent sign.[4] Thick-walled fungal hyphae are usually detected in impression smears from skin lesions. Staining with periodic acid-Schiff stain is usually confirmatory."SAKSENAEA,"Saksenaea is a genus of fungi in the Saksenaeaceae family. First described in 1953,[1] the genus contains two pathogenic species capable of causing severe human infections.[2]"SALMONELLA,"Salmonella is a genus of rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family. There are two species of Salmonella, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica. Salmonella enterica is further divided into six subspecies and over 2500 serovars.Salmonellae are found worldwide in both cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals, and in the environment. Strains of Salmonella cause illnesses such as typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and food poisoning (Salmonellosis).[1]"SANDFLY FEVER VIRUS,"Sandfly (or sand fly) is a colloquial name for any species or genus of flying, biting, blood-sucking Dipteran encountered in sandy areas. In the United States, sandfly may refer to certain horse flies that are also known as ""greenheads"" (family Tabanidae), or to members of the family Ceratopogonidae, also known in Florida and elsewhere as a sand gnat, sandflea, no-see-um (no-see-em, noseeum), granny nipper, chitra, punkie, or punky. Outside the United States, sandfly may refer to members of the subfamily Phlebotominae within the Psychodidae. Biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) are sometimes called sand flies or no-see-ums (no-see-em, noseeum). New Zealand sandflies are in the Austrosimulium genus, a type of black fly.[1]While horse flies are large flies, noseeums (sandfleas) and some Old-World sandflies are tiny midges. Sandfly bites may leave large, red itchy bumps that may turn into a rash. These bumps are frequently several times as itchy as mosquito bites, and tend to last longer as well.In the various sorts of sandfly only the female is responsible for biting and sucking the blood of mammals, reptiles and birds. She requires the protein in the blood to make her eggs.Some sandfly genera of the Phlebotominae subfamily are the primary vectors of leishmaniasis and pappataci fever; both diseases are confusingly referred to as sandfly fever. In the New World, leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies of the genus Lutzomyia; in the Old World, the disease is spread by sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus. Belize and Honduras are notorious in the Caribbean for their sandfly populations and travel pages frequently warn tourists to bring bug spray containing high concentrations of DEET."SCEDOSPORIUM,No entrySCHISTOSOMA,"A genus of trematodes, Schistosoma, commonly known as blood-flukes, are parasitic flatworms responsible for a highly significant group of infections in humans termed schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is considered by the World Health Organization as the second most socioeconomically devastating parasitic disease, (after malaria), with hundreds of millions infected worldwide.[1][2]Adult flatworms parasitize blood capillaries of either the mesenteries or plexus of the bladder, depending on the infecting species. They are unique among trematodes and any other flatworms in that they are dioecious with distinct sexual dimorphism between male and female. Thousands of eggs are released and reach either the bladder or the intestine (according to the infecting species), and these are then excreted in urine or feces to fresh water. Larvae must then pass through an intermediate snail host, before the next larval stage of the parasite emerges that can infect a new mammalian host by directly penetrating the skin."SCOPULARIOPSIS,"Scopulariopsis is a genus of anamorphic fungi that are saprobic and pathogenic to animals.[1] The widespread genus contains 22 species.[2] Scopulariopsis belongs to the group Hyphomycetes. These species are commonly found in soil, decaying wood, and various other plant and animal products. In indoor environment Scopulariopsis is found on dry walls, cellulose board, wallpaper, wood, and mattress dust. Species of Scopulariopsis have also been isolated from carpets, hospital floors, swimming pools, wooden food packing, shoes and wood pulp. Scopulariopsis species are sometimes encountered growing on meat in storage. Some of the common species are S. brevicaulis, S. brumptii, S. candida and S. asperula"SERRATIA,"Serratia is a genus of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The most common species in the genus, S. marcescens, is normally the only pathogen and usually causes nosocomial infections. However, rare strains of S. plymuthica, S. liquefaciens, S. rubidaea, and S. odoriferae have caused diseases through infection.[2] Members of this genus produce characteristic red pigment, prodigiosin, and can be distinguished from other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae by their unique production of three enzymes: DNase, lipase, and gelatinase.[3]"SHEWANELLA,"Shewanella is the sole genus included in the Shewanellaceae family of marine bacteria, some species within it were formerly classed as Alteromonas. Shewanella bacteria are a normal component of the surface flora of fish and are implicated in fish spoilage."SHIGELLA,"Shigella is a genus of Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, nonspore-forming, nonmotile, rod-shaped bacteria closely related to Salmonella. The genus is named after Kiyoshi Shiga, who first discovered it in 1897.[1]The causative agent of human shigellosis, Shigella causes disease in primates, but not in other mammals.[2][page needed] It is only naturally found in humans and apes.[3][4] During infection, it typically causes dysentery.[5] Shigella is one of the leading bacterial causes of diarrhea worldwide. Insufficient data exist, but conservative estimates suggest Shigella causes about 90 million cases of severe dysentery, with at least 100,000 of these resulting in death each year, mostly among children in the developing world.[6]"SLACKIA,"Slackia is a genus of Actinobacteria, in the family Coriobacteriaceae."SMALL ROUND VIRUS,No entrySNEATHIA,No entrySOLOBACTERIUM,"Solobacterium moorei is a bacterium that has been identified as a contributor to halitosis.[1] It is a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus.,[2] erroneously known as Bulleidia moorei.[3] This particular strain was identified by Kageyama and Benno in 2000, previously an unclassified Clostridium group RCA59.[4]The genus Solobacterium is in the family Erysipelotrichaceae of the order Erysipelotrichales.[3]"SPHINGOBACTERIUM,Sphingobacterium is a genus in the family Sphingobacteriaceae. The genus Sphingobacterium is characterized by the high concentrations of sphingophospholipids as lipid components.SPHINGOMONAS,"Sphingomonas was defined in 1990 as a group of Gram-negative, rod-shaped, chemoheterotrophic, strictly aerobic bacteria. They possess ubiquinone 10 as their major respiratory quinone, contain glycosphingolipids (GSLs) instead of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in their cell envelopes, and typically produce yellow-pigmented colonies.[1]By 2001, the genus included more than 20 species that were quite diverse in terms of their phylogenetic, ecological, and physiological properties. As a result, the Sphingomonas were subdivided into four genera: Sphingomonas, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, Sphingosinicella, and Sphingopyxis. These genera are commonly referred to collectively as sphingomonads. The sphingomonads are widely distributed in nature, having been isolated from many different land and water habitats, as well as from plant root systems, clinical specimens, and other sources; this is due to their ability to survive in low concentrations of nutrients, as well as to metabolize a wide variety of carbon sources. Numerous strains have been isolated from environments contaminated with toxic compounds, where they display the ability to utilize the contaminants as nutrients.[1]Some of the sphingomonads (especially Sphingomonas paucimobilis) also play a role in human disease, primarily by causing a range of mostly nosocomial, non-life-threatening infections that typically are easily treated by antibiotic therapy.[2][3]Due to their biodegradative and biosynthetic capabilities, sphingomonads have been utilised for a wide range of biotechnological applications, from bioremediation of environmental contaminants to production of extracellular polymers such as sphingans (e.g., gellan, welan, and rhamsan) used extensively in the food and other industries[citation needed]. The shorter carbohydrate moiety of GSL compared to that of LPS results in the cell surface being more hydrophobic than that of other Gram-negative bacteria, probably accounting for both Sphingomonas' sensitivity to hydrophobic antibiotics and its ability to degrade hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.[1] One strain, Sphingomonas sp. 2MPII, can degrade 2-methylphenanthrene.[4] In May 2008, Daniel Burd, a 16-year-old Canadian, won the Canada-Wide Science Fair in Ottawa after discovering that Sphingomonas can degrade over 40% of the weight of plastic bags (Polyethylene) in less than three months.[5]A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 expressing a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) has also been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli. This is the first report of bioprecipitation of uranium under alkaline conditions.[6]"SPOROTHRIX,"Sporothrix is a ubiquitous genus of soil-dwelling fungus discovered by Schenck in 1898[1] and studied in more detail by Hektoen and Perkins.[2] The first described and best known species is Sporothrix schenckii, the causative agent of rose handler's disease.[3] New environmental[4] and pathogenic[5][6] species have been discovered with the potential for more to be found as molecular techniques advance."SPOROTRICHUM,No entrySTAPHYLOCOCCUS,"Staphylococcus is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria. Under the microscope, they appear round (cocci), and form in grape-like clusters.[1]The Staphylococcus genus includes at least 40 species. Of these, nine have two subspecies and one has three subspecies.[2] Most are harmless and reside normally on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and other organisms. Found worldwide, they are a small component of soil microbial flora.[3]"STENOTROPHOMONAS,"Stenotrophomonas is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria.[1] With species ranging from common soil organisms (S. nitritireducens) to opportunistic human pathogens (S. maltophilia), the molecular taxonomy of the genus is still somewhat unclear.[2]"STOMATOCOCCUS,No entrySTREPTOBACILLUS,"Streptobacillus is a genus of aerobic, gram-negative facultative anaerobe bacteria, which grow in culture as rods in chains.Species associated with infection - S. moniliformisReported susceptibilities and therapies - penicillin, erythromycin"STREPTOCOCCUS,"Streptococcus is a genus of coccus (spherical) Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes[3] and the Lactobacillales (lactic acid bacteria) order. Cellular division occurs along a single axis in these bacteria, and thus they grow in chains or pairs, hence the name from Greek streptos, meaning easily bent or twisted, like a chain (twisted chain).Contrast this with Staphylococci, which divide along multiple axes and generate grape-like clusters of cells. Most Streptococci are oxidase- and catalase-negative, and many are facultative anaerobes.In 1984, many organisms formerly considered Streptococcus were separated out into the genera Enterococcus and Lactococcus.[4] Currently, over 50 species are recognised in this genus."STREPTOMYCES,"Streptomyces is the largest genus of Actinobacteria and the type genus of the family Streptomycetaceae.[1] Over 500 species of Streptomyces bacteria have been described.[2] As with the other Actinobacteria, streptomycetes are Gram-positive, and have genomes with high GC content.[3] Found predominantly in soil and decaying vegetation, most streptomycetes produce spores, and are noted for their distinct ""earthy"" odor that results from production of a volatile metabolite, geosmin.Streptomycetes are characterised by a complex secondary metabolism.[3] They produce over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin (e.g., neomycin, cypemycin, grisemycin, bottromycins and chloramphenicol).[4][5] The now uncommonly used streptomycin takes its name directly from Streptomyces. Streptomycetes are infrequent pathogens, though infections in humans, such as mycetoma, can be caused by S. somaliensis and S. sudanensis, and in plants can be caused by S. caviscabies, S. acidiscabies, S. turgidiscabies and S. scabies."STRONGYLOIDES,"Strongyloides (from Greek strongylos, round, + eidos, resemblance), Anguillula, or threadworm is a genus of small nematode parasites, belonging to the family Strongyloididae, commonly found in the small intestine of mammals (particularly ruminants), that are characterized by an unusual life cycle that involves one or several generations of free-living adult worms.Human infection, strongyloidiasis, is chiefly caused by Strongyloides stercoralis, widespread in all tropical regions, or by Strongyloides fuelleborni, a parasite of primates in African and Asian tropics and of humans in African tropics and New Guinea. Other species include Strongyloides papillosus found in cows, pigs, sheep, goats, rabbits, and rats, Strongyloides ransomi found in pigs and Strongyloides ratti, found in rats."SUTTONELLA,No entryTAENIA,"Taenia is a genus of tapeworms (a type of helminth) that includes some important parasites of livestock. Members of the genus are responsible for taeniasis and cysticercosis in humans, which are a type of helminthiasis belonging to the group of neglected tropical diseases. More than 100 species are recorded. They are morphologically characterized by a ribbon-like body composed of a series of segments called proglottids; hence the name Taenia (Greek tainia meaning ribbon, bandage, or stripe). The anterior end of the body is the scolex. Not all members of the genus Taenia have an armed scolex (hooks and/or spines located in the ""head"" region), for example, Taenia saginata has an unarmed scolex, while Taenia solium has an armed scolex.[1]Proglottids have a central ovary, with a vitellarium (yolk gland) posterior to it. As in all cyclophyllid cestodes, a genital pore occurs on the side of the proglottid. Eggs are released when the proglottid deteriorates, so a uterine pore is unnecessary."TETANUS CLINICAL WITH NO ORGANISM,"Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is an infection characterized by muscle spasms. In the most common type the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body. These spasms usually last a few minutes each time and occur frequently for three to four weeks.[1] Spasms may be so severe that bone fractures may occur.[2] Other symptoms may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate.[1][2] Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection. It may take months to recover. About 10% of those infected die.[1]Tetanus is caused by an infection with the bacterium Clostridium tetani,[1] which is commonly found in soil, dust and manure.[3] The bacteria generally enter through a break in the skin such as a cut or puncture wound by a contaminated object.[3] They produce toxins that interfere with muscle contractions, resulting in the typical symptoms.[4] Diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms. The disease does not spread between people.[1]Infection can be prevented by proper immunization with the tetanus vaccine. In those who have a significant wound and less than three doses of the vaccine both immunization and tetanus immune globulin are recommended. In those who are infected tetanus immune globulin or if not available intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used. The wound should be cleaned and any dead tissue removed.[1] Muscle relaxants may be used to control spasms. Mechanical ventilation may be required if a person's breathing is affected.[4]Tetanus occurs in all parts of the world but is most frequent in hot and wet climates where the soil contains a lot of organic matter.[1] In 2013 it caused about 59,000 deaths - down from 356,000 in 1990.[5] Description of the disease by Hippocrates exists from at least as far back as the 5th century BCE. The cause of the disease was determined in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone at the University of Turin with a vaccine being developed in 1924.[1]"TICK,"Ticks are small arachnids in the order Parasitiformes.[1][2][3] Along with mites, they constitute the subclass Acarina. Ticks are ectoparasites (external parasites), living by hematophagy on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. Ticks are vectors of a number of diseases that affect both humans and other animals.Despite their poor reputation among human communities, ticks may play an ecological role by ailing infirm animals and preventing overgrazing of plant resources.[4]"TOXOCARA,No entryTOXOPLASMA,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate, intracellular, parasitic protozoan that causes the disease toxoplasmosis.[1] Found worldwide, T. gondii is capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals,[2] although felids such as domestic cats are the only known definitive hosts in which the parasite can undergo sexual reproduction.[3]In humans, T. gondii is one of the most common parasites;[4] serological studies estimate that 30-50% of the global population has been exposed to and may be chronically infected with T. gondii, although infection rates differ significantly from country to country.[5][6] For example, previous estimates have shown the highest prevalence of persons infected with T. gondii to be in France, at 84%.[7] Although mild, flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks following exposure, infection with T. gondii produces no readily observable symptoms in healthy human adults.[5][8][9] This asymptomatic state of infection is referred to as a latent infection and has recently been associated with numerous subtle adverse or pathological behavioral alterations in humans.[5][10] In infants, HIV/AIDS patients, and others with weakened immunity, infection can cause serious and occasionally fatal illness (toxoplasmosis).[8][9]T. gondii has been shown to alter the behavior of infected rodents in ways thought to increase the rodents' chances of being preyed upon by cats.[7][11][12] Support for this ""Manipulation Hypothesis"" stems from studies showing T. gondii infected rats have a decreased aversion to cat urine and increased reaction time.[7] Because cats are the only hosts within which T. gondii can sexually reproduce to complete and begin its lifecycle, such behavioral manipulations are thought to be evolutionary adaptations to increase the parasite's reproductive success.[7] The primary mechanisms of T. gondii-induced behavioral changes in rodents is now known to occur through epigenetic remodeling in neurons which govern the associated behaviors;[13][14] for example, it modifies epigenetic methylation to cause hypomethylation of arginine vasopressin-related genes in the medial amygdala to greatly decrease predator aversion.[13][14] Widespread histone-lysine acetylation in cortical astrocytes appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by T. gondii.[15][16] Differences in aversion to cat urine are observed between non-infected and infected humans and sex differences within these groups were apparent as well.[17]A number of studies have suggested subtle behavioral or personality changes may occur in infected humans,[18] and infection with the parasite has recently been associated with a number of neurological disorders, particularly schizophrenia.[12] A 2015 study also found cognitive deficits in adults to be associated with joint infection by both toxoplasma gondii and helicobacter pylori in a regression model with controls for race-ethnicity and educational attainment.[19] However, although a causal relationship between latent toxoplasmosis with these neurological phenomena has not yet been established,[5][12] preliminary evidence suggests that T. gondii infection can induce some of the same alterations in the human brain as those observed in mice.[20][21]"TREMATODES,"Trematoda is a class within the phylum Platyhelminthes. It includes two groups of parasitic flatworms, known as flukes.They are internal parasites of molluscs and vertebrates. Most trematodes have a complex life cycle with at least two hosts. The primary host, where the flukes sexually reproduce, is a vertebrate. The intermediate host, in which asexual reproduction occurs, is usually a snail."TREPONEMA,"Treponema is a genus of spiral-shaped bacteria. The major treponeme species of human pathogens is Treponema pallidum, whose subspecies are responsible for diseases such as syphilis, bejel, and yaws. Treponema carateum is the cause of pinta.[1] Treponema paraluiscuniculi is associated with syphilis in rabbits."TRICHINELLA,"Trichinella is the genus of parasitic roundworms of the phylum Nematoda that cause trichinosis (also known as trichinellosis). Members of this genus are often called trichinella or trichina worms. A characteristic of Nematoda is the one-way digestive tract, with a pseudocoelom (body cavity made up of only an ectoderm and endoderm).The genus was first recognised in a larval form in 1835. The L1 larvae live in a modified skeletal muscle cell. The adult worms occupy a membrane-bound portion of columnar epithelium, living as intramulticellular parasites. Infections with this genus have been reported from more than 150 different naturally or experimentally infected hosts. It has been shown to have a worldwide distribution in domestic and/or sylvatic animals.Trichinella is known as the smallest human nematode parasite, yet it is also the largest of all intracellular parasites.Oral ingestion of larvae-contaminated tissue is the usual route of infection, but congenital and mammary transmission can occur in rats.[1]"TRICHODERMA,"Trichoderma is a genus of fungi that is present in all soils, where they are the most prevalent culturable fungi. Many species in this genus can be characterized as opportunistic avirulent plant symbionts.[1] This refers to the ability of several Trichoderma species to form mutualistic endophytic relationships with several plant species.[2] The genomes of several Trichoderma species have been sequenced and are publicly available from the JGI.[3]"TRICHOMONAS,"Trichomonas is a genus of anaerobic protists that are parasites of vertebrates. They are included with the Parabasalids,Species of Trichomonas include:Trichomonas vaginalis, an organism generally living inside the human urinogenital tract.Trichomonas gallinae, which infects birds, causing canker in pigeons and doves, and frounce in raptors. Frounce-like lesions found in the fossil jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus rex were probably caused by a parasite similar to Trichomonas gallinae.[1]Trichomonas tenax, an organism found in the oral cavity of humans, cats, and dogsTrichomonas termopsidis, found in termite guts[2]"TRICHOPHYTON,"Trichophyton is a genus of fungi, which includes the parasitic varieties that cause tinea, including athlete's foot, ringworm, jock itch, and similar infections of the nail, beard, skin and scalp. Trichophyton fungi are molds characterized by the development of both smooth-walled macro- and microconidia. Macroconidia are mostly borne laterally directly on the hyphae or on short pedicels, and are thin- or thick-walled, clavate to fusiform, and range from 4 to 8 by 8 to 50 micrometres in size. Macroconidia are few or absent in many species. Microconidia are spherical, pyriform to clavate or of irregular shape, and range from 2 to 3 by 2 to 4 micrometres in size."TRICHOSPORON,"Trichosporon is a genus of anamorphic fungi in the family Trichosporonaceae. All species of Trichosporon are yeasts with no known teleomorphs (sexual states). Most are typically isolated from soil, but several species occur as a natural part of the skin microbiota of humans and other animals. Proliferation of Trichosporon yeasts in the hair can lead to an unpleasant but non-serious condition known as white piedra. Trichosporon species can also cause severe opportunistic infections (trichosporonosis) in immunocompromised individuals."TRICHOSTRONGYLUS,"Trichostrongylus species are nematodes (round worms), which are ubiquitous among herbivores worldwide, including cattle, sheep, donkeys, goats, deer, and rabbits.[1][2][3] At least 10 Trichostrongylus species have been associated with human infections.[1] Infections occur via ingestion of infective larvae from contaminated vegetables or water.[1][3] Epidemiological studies indicate a worldwide distribution of Trichostrongylus infections in humans, with the highest prevalence rates observed in individuals from regions with poor sanitary conditions, in rural areas, or who are farmers / herders.[4][5] Human infections are most prevalent in the Middle East and Asia,[3] with a worldwide estimated prevalence of 5.5 million people.[1]"TRICHURIS,"Trichuris, often referred to as whipworms (which typically refers to T. trichiura only in medicine, and to any other species in veterinary medicine), is a genus of parasite worms from the roundworm family Trichuridae, which is a type of helminth. The name whipworm refers to the shape of the worm; they look like whips with wider ""handles"" at the posterior end. The name Trichocephalus is sometimes used for this genus.[1]The genus Trichuris includes over 20 species which infect the large intestine of their host including:Trichuris trichiura (sometimes Trichocephalus trichiuris) - causes trichuriasis in humans],Trichuris campanula (cat whipworm),Trichuris suis (pig whipworm),Trichuris muris (mouse whipworm),Trichuris vulpis (dog whipworm).A new species - as yet unnamed - has been identified in Francois leaf monkey (Trachypithecus francoisi).[2]Other species in this genus include Trichuris cynocephalus, Trichuris discolor, Trichuris laevitestis,Trichuris pardinasi, Trichuris navonae,Trichuris ovis, Trichuris rhinopithecus, Trichuris thrichomysi and Trichuris travassosi.Trichurias is a soil-transmitted helminthias and belongs to the group of neglected tropical diseases, affecting about 604 million people globally.[3]"TROPHERYMA,"Tropheryma whipplei, formerly called Tropheryma whippelii,[1] is a bacterium and the causative organism of Whipple's disease[2] and rarely endocarditisWhile T. whipplei is categorized with the Gram-positive Actinobacteria, the organism is commonly found to be Gram-negative or Gram-indeterminate when stained in the laboratory.[2] Whipple himself probably observed the organisms as rod-shaped structures with silver stain in his original case.[3]"TRUEPERELLA,No entryTRYPANOSOMA,"Trypanosoma is a genus of kinetoplastids (class Kinetoplastida), a monophyletic[1] group of unicellular parasitic flagellate protozoa. The name is derived from the Greek trypano- (borer) and soma (body) because of their corkscrew-like motion. Most trypanosomes are heteroxenous (requiring more than one obligatory host to complete life cycle) and most are transmitted via a vector. Some, such as Trypanosoma equiperdum, are spread by direct contact. The majority of species are transmitted by blood-feeding invertebrates, but there are different mechanisms among the varying species. In an invertebrate host they are generally found in the intestine, but normally occupy the bloodstream or an intracellular environment in the mammalian host.Trypanosomes infect a variety of hosts and cause various diseases, including the fatal human diseases sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei, and Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi.The mitochondrial genome of the Trypanosoma, as well as of other kinetoplastids, known as the kinetoplast, is made up of a highly complex series of catenated circles and minicircles and requires a cohort of proteins for organisation during cell division."ULOCLADIUM,"Ulocladium is a genus of fungi. Species of this genus contain both plant pathogens and food spoilage agents. Other species contain enzymes that are biological control agents. Some members of the genus can invade homes and are a sign of moisture because the mold requires water to thrive. They can cause plant diseases or hay fever and more serious infections in immuno-suppressed individuals.Species of Ulocladium resemble those of genus Alternaria with which they were once included. But Ulocladium, unlike Alternaria, do not produce alternariols, tenuazonic acid, altersolanols, or macrosporin.The species Ulocladium oudemansii is utilised as a biocontrol agent against Botrytis cinerea. The New Zealand company Botryzen (2010) Ltd uses it to control Botrytis bunch rot in the NZ vineyard industry"UREAPLASMA,"The Mycoplasmataceae is a family of bacteria [1] in the order Mycoplasmatales. This family comprises the genera Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma.In 1967 the Order Mycoplasmatales was incorporated into the class Mollicutes.[2] Many species are sexually transmitted and cause Pelvic inflammatory disease."VACCINIA VIRUS,"Vaccinia virus (VACV or VV) is a large, complex, enveloped virus belonging to the poxvirus family.[1] It has a linear, double-stranded DNA genome approximately 190 kbp in length, and which encodes approximately 250 genes. The dimensions of the virion are roughly 360 - 270 - 250 nm, with a mass of approximately 5-10 fg.[2]Smallpox was the first disease to be widely prevented by vaccination due to pioneering work by the English physician and scientist Edward Jenner in the eighteenth century using cowpox virus. Vaccinia virus is the active constituent of the vaccine that eradicated smallpox, making it the first human disease to be eradicated. This endeavour was carried out by the World Health Organization under the Smallpox Eradication Program. Post eradication of smallpox, scientists study vaccinia virus to use as a tool for delivering genes into biological tissues (gene therapy and genetic engineering) and because of concerns about smallpox being used as an agent for bioterrorism."VAGOCOCCUS,No entryVAHLKAMPFIA,Vahlkampfia is a genus of amoeboids in Heterolobosea.[1]VEILLONELLA,"Veillonella are Gram-negative anaerobic cocci. This bacterium is well known for its lactate fermenting abilities. They are a normal bacterium in the intestines and oral mucosa of mammals. In humans they have been rarely implicated in cases of osteomyelitis and endocarditis, for example with the species Veillonella parvula."VERTICILLIUM,"Verticillium is a genus of fungi in the division Ascomycota, and are an anamorphic form of the family Plectosphaerellaceae. The genus used to include diverse groups comprising saprobes and parasites of higher plants, insects, nematodes, mollusc eggs, and other fungi, thus the genus used to have a wide-ranging group of taxa characterised by simple but ill-defined characters. The genus, currently thought to contain 51 species,[1] may be broadly divided into three ecologically based groups - mycopathogens, entomopathogens,[2] and plant pathogens and related saprotrophs.[3] However, the genus has undergone recent revision into which most entomopathogenic and mycopathogenic isolates fall into a new group called Lecanicillium. The genus now includes the plant-pathogenic species V. dahliae, V. longisporum, V. albo-atrum, V. nubilum, and V. tricorpus.The better-known species of Verticillium are V. dahliae, V. albo-atrum and V. longisporum, which cause wilt diseases called verticillium wilts in more than 400 eudicot plant species."VIBRIO,"Vibrio is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria possessing a curved-rod shape (comma shape),[1][2][3] several species of which can cause foodborne infection, usually associated with eating undercooked seafood. Typically found in salt water, Vibrio species are facultative anaerobes that test positive for oxidase and do not form spores.[4] All members of the genus are motile and have polar flagella with sheaths. Recent phylogenies have been constructed based on a suite of genes (multilocus sequence analysis).[1]The name Vibrio derives from Filippo Pacini, who isolated micro-organisms he called ""vibrions"" from cholera patients in 1854, because of their motility.[5]"WEEKSELLA,No entryWEISSELLA,"Weissella[1] is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria, placed within the family Leuconostocaceae, and formerly considered species of the Leuconostoc paramesenteroides group.[2] The morphology of Weissella species varies from spherical or lenticular cells to irregular rods."WOLINELLA,No entryYERSINIA,"Yersinia is a genus of bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Yersinia species are Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria, a few micrometers long and fractions of a micrometer in diameter, and are facultative anaerobes.[1] Some members of Yersinia are pathogenic in humans; in particular, Y. pestis is the causative agent of the plague. Rodents are the natural reservoirs of Yersinia; less frequently, other mammals serve as the host. Infection may occur either through blood (in the case of Y. pestis) or in an alimentary fashion, occasionally via consumption of food products (especially vegetables, milk-derived products, and meat) contaminated with infected urine or feces.Speculations exist as to whether or not certain Yersinia can also be spread by protozoonotic mechanisms, since Yersinia species are known to be facultative intracellular parasites; studies and discussions of the possibility of amoeba-vectored (through the cyst form of the protozoan) Yersinia propagation and proliferation are now in progress.[2]"
